    Reading Wisely
    The youngster who reads voraciously, though indiscriminately, does not necessarily gain in wisdom over the
    teenager who is more selective in his reading choices. A young man who has read the life story of every eminent
    athlete of the twentieth century, or a coed who has steeped herself in every social-protest novel she can get her
    hands on, may very well be learning all there is to know in a very limited area. But books are replete with so many
    wonders that it is often discouraging to see bright young people limit their own experiences.

    Solving the Servant Problem
    The worlds of science-fiction abound with wonders. Yet modern technology progresses so rapidly that what may
    be today's wild dream may be next year's kitchen appliance. A British scientist has prognosticated that within ten
    years every suburban matron will have her own robot servant. One task this domesticated automaton will not have
    to contend with will be scouring the oven because even today the newest ranges can be "programed" to reduce
    their own baked-on grime to easily disposed of ashes.

    The Decline of Mullins
    Mullins sought solace in whiskey. Once a highly respected aspirant for the lightweight crown, he now found
    himself associating with the dregs of Skid Row.* He would work himself into an alcoholic frenzy in which he
    would trumpet scurrilous attacks on the champ, the old manager, and the judge. One avid* fight fan attributed
    Mullins' absence from the ring to sickness, saying that he was "recovering from a bad case ofSCOTCH."

    Cheating
    During my first weeks at the new school I observed that cheating was rampant. I had always considered it rather
    inane to cheat on a test because of my code of ethics, and because so much was at stake. Apparently the other

    The Newspaper Umbrella
    Our neighbor is an affluent inventor whose latest brainstorm, a feasible umbrella substitute, has been featured in
    many magazines. As simply as the eye can discern, it is a hard plastic strip, about the size of a ruler, which fits
    comfortably into a woman's handbag or a man's suit jacket. If a person is caught in a sudden rainstorm, he swings
    the plastic open in the shape of a cross. Attached to each arm is a clip-like device. Next, he takes the newspaper he
    is carrying and slides it under each of the four clips. Now, equipped with a rigid head covering he can sally forth
    to face the elements. To the consternation of the umbrella manufacturers, it has been enjoying a brisk sale,
    especially among commuters. If it continues to do well, it could have a pernicious* effect upon the umbrella
    industry.

    teacher, an implacable foe of nonconformists, who went into a paroxysm of anger when she spied the boys in the
    hall. At first it seemed like a simple case. The school would reprimand* the boys for their reprehensible appearance
    and order them to cut their hair or be suspended. But the boys' parents decided that the school had overstepped its

    Enter Dr. Thomas A. Dooley
    In 1956, Look Magazine named Thomas Dooley as one of the year's ten most outstanding men. Just under thirty
    years of age at the time, Dr. Dooley had already distinguished himself by caring for a half-million sick and
    emaciated Vietnamese refugees. When fighting broke out in the divided country of Viet Nam, the northern
    Communist Viet Minh forces surged southward, scattering thousands of refugees before them. At the time, Dr.
    Dooley was a lieutenant, assigned to a tranquil naval hospital in Yokosuka, Japan. Forthwith* he volunteered for
    duty on a navy ship that had been chosen to transport the refugees to sanctuary in Saigon. The curtain was
    beginning to ascend on Dooley's real career.

    Dooley's Mission
    Aboard the refugee ship, Dooley's destiny took shape. He became painfully cognizant* of the malnutrition, disease,
    ignorance, and fear that afflicted the natives. In addition, he discerned* how active the Communists had been in
    spreading their anti-American propaganda. Tom Dooley pitched in to build shelters in Haiphong, and to comfort
    the poor Vietnamese there before that besieged city fell to the powerful Viet Minh forces. He was seemingly
    unconcerned by the many privations he had to endure. For his services, Dooley received the U.S. Navy's Legion of
    Merit. He told the story of this exciting experience in Deliver Us from Evil, a best seller that alerted America to the
    plight of the Vietnamese as well as to the sinister menace of communism.

    Stymied* by Personal Sickness
    After an extensive lecture tour in 1956, Dr. Dooley returned to Laos to set up a mobile medical unit. Because the

    to work as a civilian. That story is told in The Edge of Tomorrow. Next year, despite a growing illness, the
    ubiquitous Dooley turned up in the remote village of Muong Sing, attempting to thwart his traditional

    ''Promises to Keep"
    From August, 1959 until his death in January, 1961, Dooley suffered almost continuous, excruciating pain. His
    normal weight of 180 was cut in half, and even the pain-killing drugs could no longer bring relief. Knowing that he
    did not have long to live, Dr. Dooley worked without respite on behalf of MEDICO, the organization he had
    founded to bring medical aid and hope to the world's sick and needy. The lines of Robert Frost kept reverberating
    in his mind during those fretful days: "The woods are lovely, dark and deep/ But I have promises to keep/ And
    miles to go before I sleep." When he finally succumbed, millions throughout the world were stunned and grief-

    Bigots* Get Publicity
    Today, the blatant bigot, the leader of a lunatic fringe, and the hate-monger, each with his tiny entourage, find it
    relatively easy to attract publicity. Newspapers give space to the virulent activities of those agitators on the grounds
    that they are newsworthy. TV producers and radio executives, seeking for sensationalism, often extend a welcome
    to such controversial characters. "Yes," said the host of one such program, "we invite bigots, but it is only for the
    purpose of making them look ridiculous by displaying their inane* policies to the public." Some civic-minded

    Coping with Bigots*
    Suppose a bigot wished to organize a meeting in your neighborhood. Since we cherish freedom of speech, we are
    loath to deny the request, even if he preaches hatred. As a result, hate-mongers are given the opportunity to rent
    halls, conduct meetings, publish abusive literature, and solicit contributions. What can be done about them? One
    astute observer, Prof. S. Andhil Fineberg, advocates the "quarantine method." His plan is to give such groups no

    More than Silence
    The quarantine method for handling bigots implies more than giving them the silent treatment. Prof. Fineberg urges
    community-relations organizations to scrutinize the nefarious activities of hate-mongers and to be prepared to
    furnish information about them to amicable inquirers. When a rabble-rouser is coming, those organizations should
    privately expose him to opinion-molders. In addition, constructive efforts should be taken to induce people to

    No Relief
    The normally phlegmatic Jerry Hart was deeply upset. Twenty-four hours had passed without result, and even if the
    rabies could not be corroborated, Jerry was determined to see that his son received the vaccine. At the suggestion
    of some friends, he organized a comprehensive search party, zealously fanning out in circles around the

    The Police Find the Dog
    Forty hours had elapsed before the police work and the publicity paid off. By meticulously checking the
    registrations of every red station wagon in the neighborhood and then cross-checking dog licenses, the police
    narrowed the search to four owners. After a few telephone calls, the apologetic owner was located and directed to
    bring her muzzled German shepherd to the Hart domicile. Bobby identified the dog, and the animal was taken to a
    veterinary's clinic to have the necessary tests performed. The lax owner, Mrs. McGraw, admitted that the dog had a

    A Visit to the President
    In the winter of 1941, Enrico Fermi and a number of other distinguished scientists importuned President Franklin
    Roosevelt for authorization to begin an all-out effort in atomic energy research. The scientists were alarmed by
    incontrovertible evidence of surreptitious German experiments, and they asked for speedy approval. Italian-born
    Enrico Fermi was the ideal man to lead the atomic research. Already in 1938 he had won the Nobel Prize for work
    with radioactive elements and neutron bombardment. Fermi had found a haven from the Fascists (his wife was
    Jewish) and he knew that if the Germans were the first to develop an atomic bomb it would mean that Hitler could

    The Ultimate Weapon Takes Shape
    Enrico Fermi designed a device that could eventuate in a chain reaction. It consisted of layers of graphite,
    alternated with chunks of uranium. The uranium emitted neutrons, and the graphite slowed them down. Holes were
    left for long cadmium safety rods. By withdrawing those control rods Fermi could speed up the production of
    neutrons, thus increasing the number of uranium atoms that would be split (fission). When the rods were
    withdrawn to a critical point, then the neutrons would be produced so fast that the graphite and cadmium could not
    absorb them. In that manner a chain reaction would result. Slowly, Fermi's first atomic pile began to grow in a
    subterranean room at Columbia University. The big question remainedwas it viable?

    reached. Three brave young men jeopardized their lives by ascending* the pile, ready to cover it with liquid
    cadmium if anything went wrong. Almost fifty scientists and several incredulous observers mounted a balcony to
    watch. One physicist remained on the floor; it was his job to extract the final cadmium control rod. Unbearable

    controlled the skies without a U.S. plane to repulse their attack. The havoc was enormous. Without hesitating,

    The Heroism of Dorie Miller
    Men all around Miller were succumbing* to the lethal spray of Japanese bullets. He dragged his captain to safety
    and turned back to see that the machine-gunner had been killed. Dorie took the big gun and trained it on the
    incoming bombers. Within the space of ten minutes he was credited with destroying four bombers while dodging
    the bullets of their fighter escorts. The enemy scurried away, having struck the incisive blow that precipitated U.S.
    entrance into World War II. Amidst the dead bodies and the ruined fleet were the heroes such as Dorie Miller. The
    Navy had told him that he did not have to fight but he hadn't listened. The Navy had attempted to stereotype him,

    ''For Distinguished Devotion to Duty"

    Danny Escobedo Goes to Jail
    In 1960, a young Chicagoan, Danny Escobedo, was given a 20-year jail sentence for first-degree murder. Danny
    had confessed to complicity in the killing of his brother-in-law after the police had refused to allow him to see his
    lawyer. Actually, Danny was tricked into blaming a friend for the liquidation of his sister's husband, thereby
    establishing himself as an accomplice. Despite the fact that Danny later recanted his confession, he was found
    culpable and jailed. Danny had been stereotyped* as a hoodlum and nobody raised an eyebrow over the hapless*

    Escobedo's Lawyer Appeals
    Barry Kroll, a Chicago lawyer, took an interest in Danny Escobedo's case. Kroll felt that his client's rights under
    the Constitution had been abrogated. Since the alleged accomplice,* Escobedo, had been denied access to an
    attorney, Kroll asked the courts to invalidate the conviction. He proposed that lawyers be entitled to sit in when the
    police question a suspect but the Illinois courts rejected that on the grounds that it would effectively preclude all

    An Historic Supreme Court Ruling
    Lawyer Kroll persevered in his defense of Danny Escobedo. The case was argued before the Supreme Court, and in
    1964, in a landmark decision, the Court reversed Danny's conviction. Legal aid, said the judges, must be instantly
    available to a suspect. "A system of law enforcement that comes to depend on the confession," one Justice
    declared, "will, in the long run, be less reliable than a system that depends on extrinsic evidence independently
    secured through skillful investigation." A Justice who declaimed against the decision said, however, "I think the
    rule is ill-conceived and that it seriously fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal enforcement."

    The Effects of the Escobedo Decision
    After Danny Escobedo's release from prison, hundreds of inmates began suits for their freedom on the grounds that
    their rights had been violated, too. Each case was heard on its merits, and in numerous instances people who had
    been convicted of serious offenses were freed because of the new standards established in the Escobedo case. After
    getting out, Danny was not a paragon of virtue, according to the police. He led a nomadic existence, drifting from
    job to job, and was arrested frequently. With asperity, and a few choice epithets, Danny referred to police
    harassment.* Although the Escobedo case was a controversial one, most agree that it inspired better police

    many as 80,000 bees. Although the individual bees live for only a few days, their colony can be operative for
    several years. A cursory study of the activities of these insects reveals an orderliness and a social structure that is

    their hind legs to carry the pollen from the flowers. They fly directly back to the hive and then dance around the
    honeycomb, their movements indicating the direction of the flowers. Meanwhile, other workers have been cleaning
    cells, caring for the young, and guarding the precious cache of nectar. Another special coterie is entrusted with

    changing from a larva to a pupa, a team of workers builds a special cell for her. Soon the young queen hatches,
    eats the prepared honey, and grows strong. After she kills any rivals who have the temerity to challenge her, an
    amorous note is injected. She flies from the hive and mates with one or more drones on her first flight. Then the

    After Commander Montagu and his colleagues had been given official approval for their dangerous escapade, they
    encountered manifold problems. First, they conducted an assiduous search for a body that looked as though it had
    recently been killed in an airplane disaster. Then, a detailed history of the man had to be invented that would be so
    impeccable that the enemy would accept its authenticity. This meant documents, love letters, personal effects, keys,

    A Puzzle for His Majesty
    The conspirators had reason to exult, for all evidence attested to the fact that the German High Command was
    gullible about "Major Martin." Their defense troops were moved away from the true invasion sites and deployed to
    areas that were inconsequential. Subsequently, when the actual attack took place, Allied casualties were minimized.
    After the war, Commander Montagu received a medal from the king of England. At the presentation ceremony, the
    king politely inquired where the young officer had earned his citation. "At the Admiralty," Montagu replied,
    presenting the king with a genuine enigma.

    Teaching Chimpanzees to Talk
    Two resourceful* psychologists at the University of Nevada have made splendid progress in vocabulary
    development in chimpanzees. Following a number of abortive attempts to teach French, German, or English to
    chimps, the researchers persevered* until they hit upon the American Sign Language system that is often used by
    deaf persons. They have had to modify the language somewhat in order to accommodate the animals' spontaneous

    Chimpanzees Are Surprisingly Smart
    Washoe, the chimpanzee, has more than a veneer of intelligence; she can signal her desire to eat, go in or out, be
    covered, or brush her teeth. In addition, she can make signs for "I'm sorry," "I hurt," "Hurry," ''Give me," and a
    myriad of other terms that are familiar to young children. This urbane animal can indicate that she craves more
    dessert by putting her fingers together ("more") and then placing her index and second fingers on top of her tongue
    ("sweet"). It is irrelevant that Washoe cannot actually talk. What is important, however, is the consummate* ease

    Easy to Train
    The chimpanzees are deemed by scientists to be the closest to man of all the living apes; consequently, they are
    fairly easy to train. Several years ago, two married researchers embarked on an interesting project: they reared and
    trained a chimp in almost the same manner as they would have raised a child. The animal did beautifully,

    More Facts About Chimps
    Chimps in the laboratory have demonstrated their ability to find their way out of the most tortuous maze. They can
    press buttons, manipulate levers, avoid shocks, etc. When food is placed out of reach, the animals can prepare a
    ladder of boxes to reach it. In his natural habitat* the chimpanzee is something of an itinerant. He goes his
    nomadic* way through the jungle, living on fruit, insects, and vegetables. With the aid of his long, powerful hands
    he can swing rapidly from tree to tree and cover considerable ground in his peregrinations. Chimps are loyal in
    their conjugal relationships, taking only one mate at a time. That may be another barometer of these animals'
    superior intelligence.

    Locked in an Ivory Edifice*
    Prince Siddhartha Gautama was the scion of a family of warrior-kings in northern India. He was being
    indoctrinated for the time when he would assume his father's throne. Growing up in an atmosphere of opulence, the
    young prince was constantly shielded from the cruel realities of the world. An army of obsequious servants and
    tutors catered to his every desire, providing Siddhartha with instruction in riding, fencing, dancing, and
    paintingwhile lavishing fulsome praise upon him. It wasn't until the prince was thirty that he took the first step that
    led to his becoming the Buddha, one of the world's greatest spiritual leaders.

    A Profile of the Woman Who Drinks to Excess
    The typical alcoholic woman is above average in intelligence, in her forties, married, with two children. She started
    drinking socially in high school or college. Although frequently incapacitated, she can fabricate a story skillfully
    and thus conceal her true physical condition. She often attributes her alcoholism to connubial stress, boredom, or
    depression. A large percentage of the women give family histories of alcoholism. Most female drinkers would
    demur at the appellation of "alcoholic"and that makes their treatment all the more difficult.
    Important Note: How good a detective are you? Did you spot one of the new words that had been introduced

    Primitive Magic
    In the course of their studies of other cultures, anthropologists have reported numerous customs and practices that
    seem bizarre to the average American. Many primitive people believe that certain inanimate objects have a will of
    their own and possess some magical powers. These fetishes may be simple things like a particular feather of a bird
    or a unique pebble. The fetish might have derived its power, according to members of some tribes, from a god who
    lives within the object and has changed it into a thing of magic. Fetishes need not only be natural objects,
    however. An artifact such as a sculpture or carving is also believed to possess supernatural powers.

    Forbidden
    An outgrowth of the idea of a fetish* is the closely related practice of taboo. Whereas the gods or supernatural
    powers merely inhabit an object that is a fetish and lend it magic, they will punish the imprudent native who
    violates their prohibition of an act or use of an object or word that has become taboo. If a taboo has been broken,
    it becomes imperative for the offender to be punished. In many cases, however, the taint on the community may be
    removed after the priests have performed a special ceremony. Often, the violator of the taboo will be punished or
    die merely through his own fears of the terrible thing he has done.

    An Absurdity
    Although it is probably universal human behavior to be contemptuous of the bizarre* superstitions practiced by
    inhabitants of unfamiliar cultures, it seems to be somewhat imprudent* to laugh at others before one takes a good,
    hard look at the absurd taboos* and fetishes* one accepts as part of one's everyday life. Isn't it somewhat absurd
    when the "dyed-in-the-wool" bigot, who illogically fears the taint* of close association with blacks (behavior that
    resembles fear of a taboo), spends most of the summer lying in the sun trying to acquire the color he claims to
    abhor? Since doctors tell us that excessive sun-tanning may be a cause of skin cancer, our strange yearning for
    sun-darkened skin has all the qualities of a fetish.*

    During the Middle Ages most people believed that the devil could enter our bodies when we sneezed, because at

    volcanic eruption of modern times took place in 1883 when the island of Krakatoa in Indonesia blew up as the
    result of a volcanic explosion. An enormous tidal wave resulted that proved catastrophic* to the nearby coasts of

    regularly. The natural question is, to what do these people owe their longevity? Frequently, the answer concerns the

    virile man or robust woman. Somehow, people who reach this advanced age seem to remain eternally sturdy. There

    Music reached its pinnacle in the nineteenth century. Every leading nation produced its share of great composers.
    There was a bewildering array of national schools and musical styles as the once obscure musician came into his

    at the beginning of the nineteenth century. However, Paris was not far behind, especially in the field of operatic

    fail he turned to composing. Even though bereft of hearing at the age of 49, he did not falter in his work. Some of

    Gruff but Likeable
    In his private life Brahms was considered by his friends as an egotist. He had an extremely lofty opinion of himself
    and his talents. He was not noted for his humility. Along with this quality, Brahms was known for his pungent
    sense of humor. While his closest friends could accept his biting jokes, others found him difficult to warm up to.
    Brahms was an inveterate stay-at-home. Cambridge University conferred an honorary degree upon him, but he was
    adamant about staying at home and did not go to receive the honor. Despite the ardent* and romantic nature of his
    music, Brahms never found the right girl and remained single throughout his life.

    A Dangerous Sport
    Racing car drivers are vulnerable to dangers that other sportsmen seldom face. Drivers agree that controlling a car
    at top speeds on a winding course is a singularly* awesome* experience. There is the bedlam caused by the roaring
    motors that move the car from a standing start to 100 miles an hour in eight seconds. One is shaken by the
    cacophony of the brakes, larger than the wheels and producing during the course of a 350-mile race enough heat to
    warm an eight-room house through a hard winter. The driver needs to be on the alert to exploit any mistake by an
    opponent, and he must be constantly aware of the propinquity of sudden death. All of this makes car racing one of
    the most demanding games of all.

    The Mystery of Creativity
    In order to create, it is said that a man must be disgruntled. The creative individual is usually one who is
    dissatisfied with things as they are; he wants to bring something new into the worldto make it a different place.
    There is no infallible way to identify a potentially creative person. The speed-up in the sciences has forced schools
    and industry to seek a panacea for the shortages that they face. The need to discover and develop the creative
    person has been the source of much study. The paramount* objectives of the studies are to eradicate anything that

    daily existence is not in accord with the intrinsic* nature of the Dutch. These people are moved by strong feelings

    sold the same tulip ten times in one day. Thé entire Dutch population suffered from the craze. There was an

    A Sport for Everyone
    Of the many highly popular sports in the United States, football must be rated around the top. This sport allows the
    speedy and lithe athlete to join with the slower and obsese one in a team effort. The skills and strengths of many
    men are welded together so that one team may work as a unit to gain mastery over its opponent. The
    knowledgeable adherent of a team can follow action covering many parts of the playing field at the same time. He
    is in a state of bliss when his team executes a movement to perfection. However, there is no one more pathetic than
    the same fan when the opposition functions to equal perfection.

    In Days Gone By
    The man who best described the now extinct life aboard a steamer on the Mississippi River is Mark Twain. Having
    actually worked aboard the river boats, his writing captures the tranquil* or turbulent* events of those days. In his
    book about life on the Mississippi, Twain recalls the idyllic times when man was not in such a great rush to get
    from one place to another. One chapter deals with the races conducted between the swiftest of the boats. When a
    race was set, the excitement would galvanize activity along the river. Politics and the weather were forgotten, and
    people talked with gusto* only of the coming race. The two steamers "stripped" and got ready; every encumbrance
    that might slow the passage was removed. Captains went to extremes to lighten their boats. Twain writes of one
    captain who scraped the paint from the gaudy figure that hung between the chimneys of his steamer.

    Nothing would mortify Twain more than the fact that ferryboats, waiting to cross the river, would lose valuable
    trips because their passengers grew senile* and died waiting for his boat, the John J. Roe, to pass. Mark Twain

    The Riverboat Pilot
    The riverboat pilot was a man considered omnipotent by all. Mark Twain once held that high position. He writes
    that he felt at the zenith of his life at that time. Starting out as a fledgling pilot's apprentice, he could not abjure*
    dreams of the time he would become, "the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the
    earth." Kings, parliaments, and newspaper editors, Twain comments, are hampered and restricted. The river pilot
    issued peremptory commands as absolute monarch. The captain was powerless to interfere. Even though the pilot
    was much younger than the captain, and the steamer seemed to be in imminent* danger, the older man was
    helpless. The captain had to behave impeccably,* for any criticism of the pilot would establish a pernicious*
    precedent that would have undermined the pilot's limitless authority.

    The Double Cross
    Many incidents that took place aboard his ship are re-told by Twain. One has to do with a wealthy cattle man who
    was approached by three gamblers. The cattle farmer had let it be known that he had a great deal of money, and the
    gamblers were trying to wheedle him into a card game. He protested that he knew nothing about cards. His rustic
    appearance confirmed that fact. On the last night before landing the three gamblers got him drunk. When the first

    A Modern Aesop
    The telling of a story in simple terms that has an inherently* important message is a venerable* art form. The
    parable may be found teaching a moral lesson in the Bible. Aesop is an incontrovertible* master of the fable. This
    story form is far from antiquated* as shown by the whimsical approach to life taken by the modern Aesop, James
    Thurber. His stories lampoon the strange behavior of his fellow men. Thurber seems unable to countenance the
    ideas that permeate* our society regarding the rules by which we should live. Least of all is he able to accept the
    sanctimonious notion that some people promulgate* that good always wins out against evil. Thurber's stories often

    Modernizing a Parable*
    Thurber punctures in an incisive* way the platitudes* that come from stories handed down through the generations.
    These old saws are accepted by everyone. One such tale is about a tortoise who had read in an ancient book that a
    tortoise had beaten a hare in a race. The sage* old tortoise construed* this story to mean that he could outrun a
    hare. With equanimity he hunted for a hare and soon found one. "Do you have the effrontery to challenge me?"
    asked the incredulous* hare. "You are a nonentity," he scoffed* at the tortoise. A course of fifty feet was set out.
    The other animals gathered around the site*. At the sound of the gun they were off. When the hare crossed the
    finish line, the flabbergasted tortoise had gone approximately eight and three-quarter inches. The moral Thurber
    draws from this debacle for the tortoise: A new broom may sweep clean, but never trust an old saw.

    Things Have Changed
    Thurber modernizes an old story that everyone has read or heard. It has to do with a nefarious* wolf who kept a
    vigil* in an ominous* forest until a little girl came along carrying a basket of food for her grandmother. With
    alacrity,* this vivacious youngster told the wolf the address to which she was going. Hungry and gaunt the wolf
    rushed to the house. When the girl arrived and entered, she saw someone in bed wearing a nightcap and a
    nightgown. While the figure was dressed like her grandmother, the little girl surmised* with only a perfunctory*
    glance that it didn't have the old lady's mien. She approached and became cognizant* of the hirsute face of the
    wolf. She drew a revolver from her purse and shot the interloper* dead. Thurber arrives at a moral for this story
    that anyone would find difficult to refute: It is not so easy to fool little girls nowadays as it used to be.

    Another Surprise
    Thurber's stories are written in a jocose* manner, but they contain enough serious matter to make one pensive. He
    tells of some builders who left a pane of glass standing upright in a field near a house they were constructing. A
    goldfinch flew across the field, struck the glass and was knocked inert.* He rushed back and divulged* to his
    friends that the air had crystallized. The other birds derided* him, said he had become irrational,* and gave a
    number of reasons for the accident. The only bird who believed the goldfinch was the swallow. The goldfinch
    challenged the large birds to follow the same path he had flown. This challenge served to whet their interest, and
    they agreed with gusto.* Only the swallow abjured.* The large birds flew together and struck the glass; they were
    knocked into a stupor. This caused the astute* swallow to wince with pain. Thurber drew a moral that is the
    antithesis* of the cliché we all accept: He who hesitates is sometimes saved.

    A Man of Nature
    Henry Thoreau attempted to confront the problem and solve the enigma* of how one might earn a living and yet
    not become an ignominious* slave to the task. He viewed the industrial revolution with antipathy. Man in a servile
    role to extraneous* possessions was a main target of his writings. He believed that one could attain genuine wealth
    not by accumulating objects or money, but through enjoyment and perusal* of nature. By his own volition he gave
    up friends and comforts for a two year sojourn by himself at Walden Pond. What others might judge as penury,*
    was seen by Thoreau as the epitome* of wealth.

    The Good Life
    Thoreau's book about the austere but happy life at Walden Pond propagated* his fame around the world. He built a
    small hut and began living an ascetic* existence. He found it to be a felicitous experience. In this idyllic* setting
    he was able to spend his time reading, studying nature, writing, and thinking. Far from being indolent,* he kept
    busy in many ways. At the end of the experiment he recalled the halcyon days with pleasure. He believed he had
    learned the secret of the truly happy life. The only tenable way of life is one in harmony with nature; material
    possessions are superfluous.

    The Mind's Secrets
    The study of the human mind and behavior has had many prominent practitioners, but no one is more revered* than
    Sigmund Freud. An Austrian physician, he is said to be the father of psychoanalysis. He taught that man has a
    subconscious mind in which he keeps repugnant* memories that come to the surface surreptitiously* and motivate
    behavior. Man often tries to rationalize his actions, when, in reality, they are really the result of suppressed
    memories coming to the surface. Freud's approach to the disturbed person was to attempt therapy by examining the
    dreams that make cognizant* what the cause of the illness might be. Only with the airing of deleterious, buried
    emotions can the person move from the nascent stage to that of full health. Freud was considered an iconoclast in
    the field of psychology when his ideas first appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century.

    Amateur Psychologists
    The ideas of Freudian psychology have become part of our everyday life. Our language is replete* with clichés*
    that have their origin in Freud's writings. There is a surfeit* of amateur psychologists who, with celerity,* analyze
    an individual's problems from the slightest evidence. Despite their dubious* education and training in this field,
    they discuss symptoms and cures on a most erudite fashion. Should a person express a fear of height, this phobia is
    examined; events from childhood are considered germane to the problem. Is it possible he or she was dropped as
    an infant? Perhaps something in a dream is pertinent* to explain the feelings of vertigo that accompany height. For
    some reason, non-trained people find the Freudian approach to the workings of the human mind most conducive to
    their practicing as amateur psychologists.

    The Enigma* of Fashion
    Of all the pressures young people face, the most pernicious* is that of fashion. By this is meant the current vogue*
    in dress. The teenagers, who are so glib when they speak of "individuality," are turned into a homogeneous mass by
    the latest craze in fashion. How can youngsters who vehemently* resist advice from the older generation become
    so malleable in the hands of those who "make" fashion? Perhaps the sudden shifts in fashion occur fortuitously*.
    Or is there some group who, through legerdemain, switches styles and customs on us right before our eyes?
    Today's teenagers seem to be quite gullible* when it comes to embracing the latest trend in fashions. But then, they
    have their elders as sage* examples to follow.

    The Economics of Fashion
    In dress, the fashion appears to be "set" by a few foreign designers and a handful of affluent* individuals who
    purchase these designs. The fashion industry is cognizant* of the fact that fashions must change rapidly and often
    or their economy would become stagnant. For this industry it would prove fatal if it were not vigilant* and
    prepared well in advance for a new fashion trend.* As the old fashion becomes passé and a new fashion seems to
    be in the making, the garment manufacturers cannot afford to procrastinate. They rush large sums of money into
    production for a mass market. Having invested heavily, the manufacturers do everything possible to influence and
    motivate* the purchasers. Through every facet of publicity and advertising the industry exploits* the natural desire
    for people to be au courant* with the latest fashions.

    What Next?
    Once the fashion industry has been able to foist a new style on the teenager, the older generation tends to
    stigmatize it as some form of rebellion. What is often ignored is that the young consumers capitulate to what is
    originated* by someone outside of their group. The feelings of individuality and audacity that the teenager gets
    from a new style of dress result from the propensity* of their elders to disparage* them. The actual situation is that
    the clothing fashions soon become accepted by all; there is nothing upsetting or revolutionary about them. While
    people are becoming complacent* about the "new," the clothing industry is busy planning how to tantalize the
    teenager with next year's "fashion." This arbitrary* decision is guaranteed to foment* consternation* among adults

    To the derogatory* comments from the older generation the teenagers might retort that new fashions and styles are

    give tacit approval to the change by rushing to the department stores where they jostle* each other to buy copies of
    the more expensive dresses. The conclusion one might reach after observing how women countenance* the

    A Famous Mutiny
    One of the most repugnant* names in popular legend is that of Captain William Bligh. He was the captain of the
    H.M.S. Bounty in 1789, and the mutiny that erupted* aboard that ship was the basis for a film in which Charles
    Laughton portrayed Bligh as an awesome* bully and an unmitigated* villain. He would flay both the body and the
    spirit of anyone who crossed him. The crew developed such an aversion* to Bligh's mortifying actions and
    demeanor that, led by Fletcher Christian, they set the captain and 17 shipmates off in a lifeboat in the South
    Pacific. The ship continued to the Pitcairn Islands where the crew remained to live with the islanders. Laughton's
    delineation of Bligh remains as the image we have of him. Only recently has any attempt been made to vindicate
    Captain Bligh and to remove the heinous reputation that permeates* history.

    Fair Play!
    Recently, there has been an attempt to improve Captain Bligh's tainted* image. Historians maintain that there was
    no turpitude in Bligh's actions aboard the H.M.S. Bounty. Perhaps he was imprudent* in failing to keep his temper
    under control. While an infraction aboard ship was quickly criticized, Bligh never carried out those callous actions
    the movie dramatized in order to depict* an evil man, say his defenders. After the mutiny, Captain Bligh astutely*
    navigated the lifeboat with the other 17 men for over 3,000 miles to safety. This prodigious* feat alone, say those
    who would restore Bligh's good name, should be enough to allow for a full redress of the wrongs that have been

    Getting a Good Look

    Seeing Is Learning
    While we are all cognizant* of the importance of words to create certain impressions, gesture is relegated* to a
    much lesser role. Gestures are an important concomitant* to even the most vapid speech, enhancing it and giving
    the hearer something to look at while he listens. The value of seeing at the same time as listening was shown when
    a class at a university, unwieldy because of its large size, was split up. One group was put into a room in close
    proximity to good loudspeakers. Every nuance* of the lecturer's voice could be heard clearly. Because they had no
    person on whom to place their attention, they soon took on the appearance of extreme lassitude; most students
    became lethargic* and rested their heads on their desks. The separation of visual and aural communication tended
    to vitiate the learning process. The listening group received grades lower than those received by those who could
    look at as well as hear the instructor.

    The Hammy Old Days
    Actors depend upon their ability to gesticulate* almost as much as upon speech to obtain their desired histrionic*
    effects. With them, gesture serves much more than merely to augment speech. When their communication is by
    gesture alone, it is called pantomime. In the early silent motion picture period, gestures were flamboyant.* To show
    that he was distraught* about the danger in which the heroine had been placed, the hero would go through the most
    fatuous actions. He would stagger, beat his breast, tear his hair, and contort his face into the most doleful*
    appearance. There weren't many simple or restrained gestures in his repertoire. The heroine, to indicate her love,
    would fling her arms wide and ardently* jump into her sweetheart's arms. It was only much later that actors
    became skilled enough to communicate with the audience through discreet* gestures and almost imperceptible
    changes in facial expression that could transmit nuances* of emotion.

    Queen of the Supermarket
    The American housewife is queen of all she surveys in the supermarket. She decides what items shall be
    purchased. Grocery manufacturers are well aware of her power to make one product a success and another a
    failure. They spend huge sums developing new products with which to curry her favor. Fearful that a successful
    product will soon begin to pall, the manufacturers, without cessation,* come out with "new and improved" versions
    to whet* her appetite. Sometimes it is only a box or package that has been changedperhaps a colorful photo of a
    succulent meal on a TV dinner box. In the larger supermarkets the housewife is faced with a satiety of
    merchandise, particularly in the copiously* stocked laundry detergent section. While there may be almost no
    intrinsic difference among the many brands, advertising and packaging serves to importune* her to buy one rather
    than another.
    Did you spot it? The "new word" you've seen before? It's intrinsic.

    It's What's Outside That Counts
    Packaging of grocery items is a facet* of advertising that is too little appreciated by consumers. Walking up and
    down the aisles of a supermarket, one seldom stops to analyze the individual package in the potpourri of items on
    the shelves. The manufacturer had to glean* and test many different designs before he accepted the one you see in
    the array* before you. Before he will sanction the use of a particular can, box, or bottle, he must know many
    things about its efficacy.* He wants to know if the colors attract: a white box may denote cleanliness, a red one,
    strength. There may be a photo or a drawing that will allude to the product's use or special qualities. A lackluster*
    package may be fatal.* Next, the size and shape are important elements. The housewife may want a small package
    for easy storing, but a larger package may suggest economy. A round bottle may look attractive, but a square one
    is easier to stack. These are some of the insidious aspects of packaging, the main purpose of which is to attract
    your attention as you peruse* the crowded supermarket shelves.

    enough to jettison* any part of a product that had been accepted by the public. Year after year, the local grocery
    store owner would proffer the same box of cereal, the same house cleaner. The acceptance was of the time-tested

    The wide diversity* of reasons people have for buying one product rather than another are investigated by the

    her answers. Generally, people are not reticent* and do not begrudge giving the time and effort. The questions
    delve rather deeply, and what the artless responses divulge* will help the advertiser decide what to put into his
    next commercial. After a large number of interviews, the copious* results make it feasible* to prognosticate* how

    It Seems to Work
    Despite the antipathy* toward commercials expressed by the viewers, the remarkable success of television
    commercials in selling products makes it manifest that the advertiser has gleaned* what the viewer wants to see
    and hear from his research interview. This has helped the advertiser delve deeply into what motivates* people
    when they go into the supermarket to purchase products. The advertising agency is never capricious and can
    vindicate* spending large sums of money on research. Having uncovered what the public wants, the advertiser
    expedites* putting the requisite words, music, and photographs of the product on film. He will thus replenish the
    never-ending, ubiquitous* television commercial supply in the hope that the consumer will remember some facet*
    of the film and buy the product.

    It Takes More than Medicine
    If one were to look at the roster of physical handicaps, one would reach the somber* conclusion that the list is a
    long one. Included would be stunted development of an arm or leg due to a birth anomaly.* Others would be the
    result of a crippling disease that has caused muscles to atrophy. The list would go on with illnesses and injuries that
    maim and debilitate.* Modern medicine has done much to ameliorate the physical problems. However, there are an
    inordinate* number of problems of the handicapped that have still to be alleviated.* People are not naturally

    Doing the Right Thing
    The obstacles that frustrate* the physically handicapped person who is seeking employment may turn him into a
    cynic. Too often a prospective employer, with a rather unctuous manner, actually tends to degrade* the
    handicapped by proffering* employment that is really beneath them and their abilities. The employer appears to be
    acting in a benevolent manner, but this attitude shows no compassion,* for he really expects the person seeking the
    job to remain subservient. This iniquity cannot but give the handicapped a feeling that they are being discriminated

    A Better Way
    Why is there any question about the propriety* of hiring the physically handicapped? No one who understands
    their needs can condone* this attitude. The offering of employment should not be considered a largess. There
    should be no need to vindicate* the hiring of a handicapped person. The only criterion should be what he is

    Socially, the handicapped person is often treated as a pariah. Most people hold themselves aloof from normal

    these are people who happen to have a physical handicap; the handicap does not make them any less human. The
    iniquity* of assuming that physical superiority equals moral superiority prevents all of us from direct human

    the Latin word for wild dog, which could be found there in profuse numbers, off the coast of Africa. The dulcet
    song of the wild birds whetted* the interest of the captain. In impromptu cages hundreds were taken aboard to be
    traded. The sailors called these gray-green birds, spotted with yellow, "canaries." As they approached the island of
    Elba, near Italy, a malevolent storm put the boat in jeopardy* of sinking. A member of the crew released the birds,
    and the intrepid* canaries instinctively flew towards land. The peasants on Elba took the wild canaries in as pets.

    Well Done, Sir Knight!
    Seeking his adversaries,* the knight rides to their hideout. Despite his callow appearance, he is reputed* to disdain*
    danger and to be a prodigious* horseman. The kidnappers lose their equanimity* at his approach. They are
    appalled at the prospect, and they are in a quandary* as to which one will meet him on the field of combat. The
    leader, under duress,* rides out. "Do you have a penchant to die?" derides* the knight. More vituperative* remarks
    follow. They spur their horses toward each other. It takes but one blow for our hero to decapitate the villain. The
    others flee to avoid their imminent* destruction. The knight takes the maiden on his horse, and they ride back to
    the castle. Their wedding soon follows. Little does the knight realize that the fair maiden is a garrulous* termagant
    who will make his life miserable with caustic* remarks. Still, the cliché,* "And they lived happily ever after," must
    conclude our fabricated* tale.

    A Battle for Power
    The Inca emperor derived his prodigious* power and authority from the gods. The paramount* god was the sun
    god. It was from him the ruler passed on his prerogative to rule to his most astute* son. This nepotism had worked
    with great efficacy* for centuries. The land holdings were immense;* there were rich farmlands and llamas and
    alpacas for wool. Precious metals were plentiful: silver, copper, bronze, and the most sacred of all, gold. This metal
    resembled the sun god whom they extolled.* There was no dearth of idols and ornaments hammered from this
    gleaming metal. There was always more gold coming from the mines to replenish* the supply. At the acme* of his
    power, the Inca ruler died without naming the requisite* successor. In 1493 two sons began an internecine struggle
    for control. For the next 40 years the empire sank into the lassitude* caused by civil war.

    A Perfidious* Conqueror
    The feuding between the rival sons reached its pinnacle* in 1532; at that moment Francisco Pizarro came onto the
    scene. A native of Spain, he was sojourning* in Panama when he heard of the riches to be found in that far off
    land. Overwhelmed with cupidity,* but still a tyro when it came to wresting* power and wealth from hapless*
    people, he joined with an inveterate* adventurer. They gathered a small band of mercenaries.* The first two
    attempts failed, and Pizarro returned to Spain to request authority and money in order to conquer the West Coast of
    South America. Whether by sophistry or cajolery,* he was given the requisite* aid. With a force of 180 men, the
    dregs* of society, he invaded Inca territory. He reached the city where the current ruler, Atahualpa, was holding
    court. The Incas welcomed Pizarro who, in a factitious display of friendship, heaped encomiums upon Atahualpa.
    Unknown to the Incas, Pizarro had brought guns that were still beyond the technology* of these people. The
    obloquy of his next act, ambushing the Incas and taking Atahualpa prisoner, will live in the history books that are

    The End of an Empire
    The Machiavellian* Pizarro held the captured Atahualpa for ransom. He was adamant* about receiving a room
    filled with gold to the height of a man's shoulder. This was taken as a hyperbole at first, but Pizarro knew the
    gullible* Incas would be munificent when it came to rescuing their sacred ruler. They did not procrastinate,* and a
    frenetic* collection of gold took place. Pizarro, to whom prevarication* was natural in dealing with the Incas, had
    no qualms* about executing their ruler as soon as he had the gold. The Inca empire was moribund,* but the
    charisma that surrounded Atahualpa was such that, after his death, the Incas fought on tenaciously* in his name for
    several years. Eventually, superior weapons quelled* all opposition. A policy of genocide was adopted by the
    Spanish conquerors, and almost two million of these proud people died in the carnage* that followed. The saga* of
    an ancient civilization thus came to an end.
