Introduction
More than a half-million readers have already been exposed to the controlled vocabulary in 1100 Words You Need
to Know and the techniques that we devised to help them learn how to use those important words. We have
received grateful letters from across the country and abroad, praising us for the timeliness of our selectionwords
appearing in newspapers and books, on standardized exams, and in business correspondence.
That response is very gratifying. We realize that possessing a rich treasury of words brings material gains as well
as confidence in one's ability to communicate and to be accepted as a mature person. As you spend the time to
master the 1100 words and idiomseven 15 to 20 minutes dailyyou will discover the pleasure of recognition and
understanding when you come across these challenging words in your listening, reading, and conversing.
For the Second Edition, published in 1987, we added word games that enhanced the learning process and analogies
that were useful for those who were preparing for college entrance tests. In the Third Edition, we took into account
the newly revised SAT format by creating words-in-context segments called WORDSEARCHES, one for each of
the 46 weeks. Now, in this Fourth Edition, we have updated all of the material and added a major component, "The
Panorama of Words," where you will find a valuable sentence reference for each of the words you have learned.
The material presented is consistent with our successful blueprint of interest, variety, relevance, and repetition.
Regard it as a dividend on your investment.

Reading Wisely
The youngster who reads voraciously, though indiscriminately, does not necessarily gain in wisdom over the
teenager who is more selective in his reading choices. A young man who has read the life story of every eminent
athlete of the twentieth century, or a coed who has steeped herself in every social-protest novel she can get her
hands on, may very well be learning all there is to know in a very limited area. But books are replete with so many
wonders that it is often discouraging to see bright young people limit their own experiences.
Sample Sentences
On the basis of the above paragraph, try to use your new words in the following sentences. Occasionally it may be
necessary to change the ending of a word; e.g., indiscriminately to indiscriminate.
1. The football game was __________ with excitement and great plays.
2. The __________ author received the Nobel Prize for literature.
3. My cousin is so __________ in schoolwork that his friends call him a bookworm.
4. After skiing, I find that I have a __________ appetite.
5. Modern warfare often results in the __________ killing of combatants and innocent civilians alike.
Definitions
Now that you have seen and used the new words in sentences, and have the definitions "on the tip of your tongue,"
try to pair the words with their meanings.
6. voracious ____ a. of high reputation, outstanding
7. indiscriminate ____ b. completely filled or supplied with
8. eminent ____ c. choosing at random without careful selection
9. steeped ____ d. desiring or consuming great quantities
10. replete ____ e. soaked, drenched, saturated

Solving the Servant Problem
The worlds of science-fiction abound with wonders. Yet modern technology progresses so rapidly that what may
be today's wild dream may be next year's kitchen appliance. A British scientist has prognosticated that within ten
years every suburban matron will have her own robot servant. One task this domesticated automaton will not have
to contend with will be scouring the oven because even today the newest ranges can be "programed" to reduce
their own baked-on grime to easily disposed of ashes.
Sample Sentences
Now that you've seen the words used in context, andhopefullyhave an idea of their meanings, try to use them in the
following sentences. Remember that a word-ending may have to be changed.
1. The mayor refused to __________ as to his margin of victory in the election.
2. The time is approaching when human workers may be replaced by __________.
3. A clever salesman will always ask a __________ if her mother is at home.

It's a Man's World
How paradoxical that the world's greatest chefs have all been men! Cooking would clearly seem to be a field that
lies exclusively within women's realm, yet the annals of cookery are replete* with masculine names: Brillat

doubts on the masculinity of these heroes of cuisine.

It is difficult to change someone's opinion by badgering him. The child who begs his mother to "get off his back"
when she implores him for some assistance with the household drudgery, may very well plead interminably for

no one likes being nagged.

week.
Reggie the Con Man
In the
__________ of crime, there are few scoundrels who could match the exploits of Reggie Hayes, who also
used the names of Reginald Haven, Ricardo Hermosa, Father Harris, and dozens of other aliases. Reggie's police
record, principally in Chicago and Baltimore, is
__________ with scams that he perpetrated upon gullible
people. Generally, his favorite target was a
__________ who should have known better.
Dressed as a priest (''Father Harris"), he was most convincing, however. His method of operation was to "find" a
wallet stuffed with hundred dollar bills outside a supermarket and then
__________ an unsuspecting woman to
share his good fortune, since there was no identification in the wallet. But first, to establish her credibility, his
victim had to put up a sum of money as a testimonial to her good faith. Mrs. Emma Schultz, age 72, tearfully told
the police that she had withdrawn $14,000 from her bank and placed it in a shopping bag supplied by the helpful
priest. He told her to hold onto the bag while he went next door to a lawyer's office to make the sharing of their
good fortune legal.
After a seemingly
__________ wait, Mrs. Schultz discovered to her chagrin that the heartless thief had skipped
out the back way, leaving her "holding the bag"a switched bag containing shredded newspaperwhile he made his
getaway with her life savings.

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
The Best Laid Plans
Gloria Rogers overslept and then had to sprint to catch the same Greyhound Bus that she boarded on the last
Thursday of every month. After a three-hour uneventful ride, she finally arrived at the bus terminal where a
courtesy van was ready to transport bus passengers to Visitors Day at the State Penitentiary.
Although Gloria tried to act casual, she was more than a little nervous. Her boyfriend, Art, a convicted
__________, had managed to gain admittance to the prison's hospital on the
__________ of having a gall
bladder attack. Under her own slacks and bulky sweater, Gloria was wearing a set of clothes that she removed in
the hospital bathroom and passed on to Art. He planned to use them after making his escape in the back of the
prison ambulance that was parked outside his ward.
Art had spelled out his escape plan during Gloria's last visit, spending an hour trying to
__________ her into
being his accomplice. All that she had to do was appear to have a seizure. Then she would
__________ a story
about her epilepsy while Art, with the smuggled clothes concealed under his prison bathrobe, would slip out of the
ward during the excitement. Unfortunately for the schemers, a
__________ hospital guard spotted Art climbing
into the rear of the ambulance and quickly foiled the escape attempt. The result was that Art had three years added
to his sentence and Gloria was imprisoned for her role in the misadventure.

The Handcuff Is Quicker Than the Eye
Slippery Eddie, the infamous pickpocket, was back at work, and every detective had to be especially vigilant.*

pocket while Eddie was stammering an apology to the confused dupe. Within a week the incipient crimewave came
to an end when Slippery Eddie inadvertently chose the chief of police for his victim. Although Eddie loathes* Sing
Sing, it's his permanent address now.

Driving While Drunk
Throughout literature we find recurring tales of forthright people who are outspoken in condemning illegal
practices only to be brought low themselves when they, or members of their families, commit such acts. Since
literature reflects life, we can expect to find similar instances in which a person's
and he falls prey to the
__________ evil that he had publicly denounced.
__________ are compromised,
Take the story of Barry Vernon (not his real name), an aggressive Ohio district attorney. Vernon could be counted
upon to make
__________ remarks about anyone who was driving while intoxicated. On numerous speaking
engagements, he railed against drunkenness and swore that any such
__________ who was found behind the
wheel of a car would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
As fate would have it, Vernon's own son smashed into several cars, injuring four people seriously, and then failed a
sobriety test.
Following that
__________ violation of the law, Vernon resigned from office, saying that as a private citizen he
would continue his crusade against those who drive under the influence of alcohol. Meanwhile, he wished to spend
more time with his son to try to understand the young man's behavior.

The Newspaper Umbrella
Our neighbor is an affluent inventor whose latest brainstorm, a feasible umbrella substitute, has been featured in
many magazines. As simply as the eye can discern, it is a hard plastic strip, about the size of a ruler, which fits
comfortably into a woman's handbag or a man's suit jacket. If a person is caught in a sudden rainstorm, he swings
the plastic open in the shape of a cross. Attached to each arm is a clip-like device. Next, he takes the newspaper he
is carrying and slides it under each of the four clips. Now, equipped with a rigid head covering he can sally forth
to face the elements. To the consternation of the umbrella manufacturers, it has been enjoying a brisk sale,
especially among commuters. If it continues to do well, it could have a pernicious* effect upon the umbrella
industry.

My buddy Verne, a precocious automotive wizard, and I were inspired to do some inventing on our own. We

contains all the nutritive value of three complete meals. In addition to providing us with the vitamins and minerals
we need daily, this pill also gives a feeling of fullness. According to its sponsors, the pill will nourish and satisfy. I
hate to disparage such a laudable achievement, but to me it seems like a most objectionable discovery. Rather than
a scientific triumph, I'd be inclined to label it as an egregious* blunder, a scientific disaster, a laboratory fiasco. Is
there anyone in his right mind who thinks that a pill can replace the pleasures of devouring hot corn bread,
masticating on a thick steak, biting into crisp french fries, or attacking a chocolate sundae? I'm afraid that this is
one pill I'll have to eschew from chewing.

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
Trouble at Truman High
It was a quiet morning at Harry S Truman High School. ''Too quiet," Principal Edna Suarez remarked to her
secretary. "It's just when things are this serene that I start to get an uneasy feeling."
Mrs. Suarez's sensitivity to life among 3,000 teenagers quickly proved to be accurate. The first evidence of trouble
came with a phone call from the teacher in charge of the cafeteria who needed help to
__________ a
disturbance. When Mrs. Suarez arrived on the scene, much to her
__________, students were pounding on their
tables, throwing food on the lunchroom floor, and making a complete
__________ of school regulations. It took
the principal only a moment to
__________ who the two ringleaders were and to summon them to her office.
Vincent, 16, and Elena, 15, admitted to having stirred up the protest. They gave as their reasons the poor quality of
food served and the dirty environment. "It's like a pigsty down there," Elena declared, "and the food is fit only for
animals!"
What they had done, Mrs. Suarez told them, was inexcusable, and she ticked off a list of reasons that made their
conduct dangerous and subject to school discipline. "What you were trying to do," Mrs. Suarez explained, "might
be considered
__________ by some but you could have come to me, alone or with a committee, to register your
complaints. I would have investigated and, if there was merit to your charges, would have taken the necessary
action. Now I'll have to ask you to bring your parents to see me on Monday and to stay home until then."
Vincent and Elena seemed to be chastened by Mrs. Suarez's lecture. However, on leaving her office, Elena told an
assistant principal that in a similar incident on a television show she learned that direct, dramatic action usually
gets quicker results than lengthy debate. He advised her to bring that question up in her social studies class when
she returned from suspension.

Much Ado About a Haircut
Perhaps you read about our school in the newspapers? We were one of the first to have a showdown on the topic
of long hair for boys. Two honor students, Ron Harris and Len Chester, were sent to the principal by their French
teacher, an implacable foe of nonconformists, who went into a paroxysm of anger when she spied the boys in the
hall. At first it seemed like a simple case. The school would reprimand* the boys for their reprehensible appearance
and order them to cut their hair or be suspended. But the boys' parents decided that the school had overstepped its
jurisdiction; they took their case to the newspapers. What had started as a local skirmish now began to take on the
appearance of a full-scale war.

Once the newspapers got the story, the case of the longhairs became a cause célèbre.* Ron and Len were

one reporter wrote, "but clean-cut American boys who are being harassed by a monolithic school system." A
caustic* editorial referred to the school's decision as arbitrary and inane.* A false story even circulated about the
boys being rock-'n-roll performers whose indigent families needed their salaries. Finally, the Civil Liberties Union

should not be allowed to return to class.

The school authorities were stymied. Public opinion had been marshaled against them. No longer was it a simple

Following an executive session, the school board ordered the principal to terminate the suspension and to send the

The Reading of the Will
One full week after the funeral, the immediate family of millionaire Charles Hudson was gathered in a law office
to hear the reading of the deceased's will. Mr. Hudson's wife, thirty years his junior, was prepared for a bitter
__________ with his former wife and her son. The lawyer, Don Rollins, anticipated a
__________ session
because he was the only one who was
__________ of the contents of the revised will that Hudson had ordered
drawn up six months prior to his death.
The current Mrs. Hudson, attired in her smart widow's weeds, expected that she would receive the lion's share of
the estate. The former Mrs. Hudson felt that she was entitled to most of the estate since she was practically
__________ at the present time, despite her substantial alimony payments.
Lawyer Rollins cleared his throat and began to read:
"To my present spouse I leave my town house where she can continue to store the jewels, shoes, dresses, and furs
she accumulated in two years of shopping and marriage.
"To my son, who has put off finding a career until my estate would enrich him, I leave the sum of ten dollars for
cab fare to the unemployment office.
"To my former wife whose
__________ behavior I tolerated for three decades, I leave my beach house where
she can continue to work on her tan, something that she prized above our happiness.
"To the Society For the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals I leave the remainder of my entire estate, knowing they
will put it to better use than anyone in this room."
The lawyer was wrong. No outcries. Silence, supreme silence, reigned among the shocked audience.

Dooley's Mission
Aboard the refugee ship, Dooley's destiny took shape. He became painfully cognizant* of the malnutrition, disease,
ignorance, and fear that afflicted the natives. In addition, he discerned* how active the Communists had been in
spreading their anti-American propaganda. Tom Dooley pitched in to build shelters in Haiphong, and to comfort
the poor Vietnamese there before that besieged city fell to the powerful Viet Minh forces. He was seemingly
unconcerned by the many privations he had to endure. For his services, Dooley received the U.S. Navy's Legion of
Merit. He told the story of this exciting experience in Deliver Us from Evil, a best seller that alerted America to the
plight of the Vietnamese as well as to the sinister menace of communism.

''Promises to Keep"
From August, 1959 until his death in January, 1961, Dooley suffered almost continuous, excruciating pain. His
normal weight of 180 was cut in half, and even the pain-killing drugs could no longer bring relief. Knowing that he
did not have long to live, Dr. Dooley worked without respite on behalf of MEDICO, the organization he had
founded to bring medical aid and hope to the world's sick and needy. The lines of Robert Frost kept reverberating
in his mind during those fretful days: "The woods are lovely, dark and deep/ But I have promises to keep/ And
miles to go before I sleep." When he finally succumbed, millions throughout the world were stunned and grief-
stricken by the tragedy.

Aftermath of an Earthquake
The Egyptian earthquake in October 1992 killed 600 residents of Cairo and hospitalized thousands of others, many
of whom were expected to
__________ as a result of their injuries. Especially hard hit were the people who
inhabited the city's slums, who had to seek
__________ in those government buildings, schools, and factories
that remained standing.
Muslim fundamentalists were active in providing relief to the survivors in the form of food, water, blankets, and
tents to house the more than 300 families made homeless by the disaster. In the midst of a rubble-strewn street, a
large tent was set up, bearing the banner, "Islam is the Solution." Believers took the opportunity to spread the
message that the earthquake was a
__________ of worse things to come, and that a wayward population must
follow God's laws if they expected to
__________ to heaven.
Throughout history, following volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tidal waves, and other calamities that periodically
__________ mankind, religious leaders have used such occurrences to bring the people back to their faith.
"Unless we return to Allah," said a priest, "we can expect more divine punishment."
Since many Egyptians had expressed unhappiness about their government prior to the earthquake, there was a good
chance for Muslim fundamentalists to seize the opportunity to win new converts by showing that the answer to
recovery was not through man's efforts but through God's.

Just Spell the Name Correctly
P. T. Barnum, the great circus impresario, was once accosted* by a woman who showed him a scurrilous*
manuscript about himself, and said that unless he paid her, she would have the book printed. Barnum rejected the
extortion attempt. "Say what you please," he replied, "but make sure that you mention me in some way. Then come
to me and I will estimate the value of your services as a publicity agent." Barnum obviously felt that adverse
criticism was an asset for a public figure. A man who seeks the limelight should not care what is written about him
but should be concerned only when they stop writing about him. Barnum's philosophy suggests that we might do
well to review the plethora* of publicity given to rabble-rousers and bigots.

Bigots* Get Publicity
Today, the blatant bigot, the leader of a lunatic fringe, and the hate-monger, each with his tiny entourage, find it
relatively easy to attract publicity. Newspapers give space to the virulent activities of those agitators on the grounds
that they are newsworthy. TV producers and radio executives, seeking for sensationalism, often extend a welcome
to such controversial characters. "Yes," said the host of one such program, "we invite bigots, but it is only for the
purpose of making them look ridiculous by displaying their inane* policies to the public." Some civic-minded
organizations have answered, however, that the hosts are not always equipped to demolish those guests, and even if
they were, the audience would still be exposed to the venom they spew forth.

Coping with Bigots*
Suppose a bigot wished to organize a meeting in your neighborhood. Since we cherish freedom of speech, we are
loath to deny the request, even if he preaches hatred. As a result, hate-mongers are given the opportunity to rent
halls, conduct meetings, publish abusive literature, and solicit contributions. What can be done about them? One
astute observer, Prof. S. Andhil Fineberg, advocates the "quarantine method." His plan is to give such groups no
publicity and to ignore them completely. Without the warmth of the spotlight, he feels that the bigot will freeze and
become ineffectual. Debating with such warped minds is not feasible* and only tends to exacerbate* the situation.

More than Silence
The quarantine method for handling bigots implies more than giving them the silent treatment. Prof. Fineberg urges
community-relations organizations to scrutinize the nefarious activities of hate-mongers and to be prepared to
furnish information about them to amicable inquirers. When a rabble-rouser is coming, those organizations should
privately expose him to opinion-molders. In addition, constructive efforts should be taken to induce people to
involve themselves in projects for improving intergroup relations. Bigger than the vexatious immediate problem is
the need to find out the cause for such bigotry and to counteract this sinister* malady that afflicts a segment of our
society.

week.
This Century's Deadliest Disease
When the American public started to hear about the AIDS virus in the 1980s, there was a measure of concern but
no real alarm. After all, some said, it was a problem solely for a small group of intravenous drug users who shared
dirty needles, and for the homosexual community.
But as the numbers of afflicted people grew during the 1980s and 1990s, we began to
__________ the tragic
news stories more closely. The deaths of young people like Ryan White and Kimberly Bergalis, not members of the
at-risk groups referred to above, convinced us that what was at first regarded merely as a
__________ illness
was actually a
__________ threat to the general community.
In the mid-1980s,
__________ medical researchers were optimistic that a vaccine for AIDS would be found in
short order. Those predictions proved to be inaccurate. In October 1992, former Surgeon-General C. Everett Koop
said that he doubted we would ever find a cure for the disease. With over 200,000 Americans already having
succumbed to the
__________ killer, and another 300,000 who were HIV-positive and could contract a full-
blown form of AIDS, Koop's statement sent chills throughout the country.
A prominent AIDS expert, however, took issue with Koop. ''The fight will be difficult," said Dr. Harley Smith, "but
we will find an answer before the end of the 20th century."

the symptoms is an inability to swallow liquids. Actually, it is caused by a live virus from the saliva of an infected
animal. If saliva gets into a bite wound, the victim may get rabies. The virus travels along the nerves to the spine
and brain. Once the salient characteristics appear (ten days to six months) then death is imminent." ''What are the
symptoms?" asked Mrs. Hart. "Pain and numbness. difficulty in swallowing, headaches and nervousness. Also,
muscle spasms and convulsions." The squeamish neighbors who were engrossed in the doctor's remarks gasped. "I

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
The Potato that Strangled Idaho
People who are
__________ about the sight of blood or
__________ in horror from most forms of violence
would do well to avoid some of the movies now being shown at their local cinemas. Producers have learned that
films that scare the patrons out of their seats, ironically, put millions of fans into those seats, keeping them
__________ in the goose pimple-inducing spectacles that flash across the screen.
Of course, each movie carries with it a rating that indicates its suitability for certain age groups, either because of
its subject matter, language, presentation, or level of violence. Pictures with a "G" rating are approved for all
audiences, while, at the other end of the scale, those that are given an "X" rating are for adults only with no
children allowed under any circumstance. Getting an ''R" rating indicates that the movie is restricted (no one under
18 admitted without an adult) but some Hollywood moguls consider the "R" to be the magnet that insures box
office success. And we can be sure that as long as shock films ring up a merry tune on the cash registers, producers
will not
__________ from making them.
A director who specializes in making gory films involving monsters, vampires, and brutal serial killers boasted in a
college lecture that his work was in good taste. One student who disasgreed was provoked to
__________ that
in his opinion the diet of "shock-schlock" movies was in worse taste than those pictures that contained vulgar
language and nudity. "At least they're honest," he declared.

The Search for the Dog (Continued)
Meanwhile, the Harts had notified the local radio stations to broadcast a poignant appeal for the dog's owner to
come forward. The station was inundated with phone calls but all leads were fruitless. From what Bobby had told
them, a huge dog had leaped out from a red station wagon in the supermarket's parking lot. After biting Bobby it
vanished. The six-year-old was too concerned with the bites he had received to see where the dog disappeared to.
The boy's story was garbled, but he did remember that the animal was gray and had a collar. There was little
tangible* evidence to go on, but the police remained sanguine.

The normally phlegmatic Jerry Hart was deeply upset. Twenty-four hours had passed without result, and even if the
rabies could not be corroborated, Jerry was determined to see that his son received the vaccine. At the suggestion
of some friends, he organized a comprehensive search party, zealously fanning out in circles around the

The Police Find the Dog
Forty hours had elapsed before the police work and the publicity paid off. By meticulously checking the
registrations of every red station wagon in the neighborhood and then cross-checking dog licenses, the police
narrowed the search to four owners. After a few telephone calls, the apologetic owner was located and directed to
bring her muzzled German shepherd to the Hart domicile. Bobby identified the dog, and the animal was taken to a
veterinary's clinic to have the necessary tests performed. The lax owner, Mrs. McGraw, admitted that the dog had a
sporadic mean streak, but she scoffed* at the idea of rabies. Jerry Hart noticed for the first time in two days that
his uneasy feeling had departed.

The Harts were greatly relieved to learn that the rash conjecture about the dog was not true. Because the German
shepherd was not rabid, the necessity for the painful treatment was obviated. The police gave the dog's owner a
summons for allowing the animal to go unmuzzled. Little Bobby was treated to an ice cream sundae and a Walt
Disney double feature. The neighbors searched for other lurid happenings, and Jerry Hart went back to his office.
"What kind of dog was that?" his secretary asked. "Oh, his bark was worse than his bite," quipped Jerry.

launching into a diatribe on the importance of responsibility in the younger generation. Monte confessed that he

The need for a decision came about when Monte was invited to join a prestigious summer stock company, starting
in mid-June. As a mature "apprentice," he would be required to take tickets, paint scenery, prepare placards, assist
with lighting, costumes, and props, and carry an occasional spear in a walk-on role. Since the company would
stage five major plays during the summer, as well as a half-dozen shows for children, there was a chance that
Monte might actually get a part before too many weeks had elapsed.* In addition, he would be attending the drama

It was to be a jaunty original comedy, given a summer tryout prior to a Broadway opening. Monte, who by now

Regis, Oprah, Sally Jessy, et. al.
The television talk shows of our era, featuring such
__________ public figures as Regis Philbin, Oprah
Winfrey, and Sally Jessy Raphael, attract millions of daytime viewers and constitute a powerful influence on the
American scene. When the media can hold the attention of so sizable a chunk of couch potatoes, it pays to
scrutinize it closely.
A student at Stanford University, doing her doctoral thesis on the unusual popularity of the afternoon talk shows,
noted the fierce competition among those programs for guests who are off the beaten track. According to her:
"Almost every irregular,
__________ life-style you can think of has already been featured on one of the shows
and probably on all of them, when you add Montel Williams, Jerry Springer, and others of that
__________
who serve as network hosts. They have shown teenagers who marry people in their sixties, daughters and mothers
who date the same man, men who have gone through a marriage ceremony with other men, women with prominent
tattoos, and other people who are totally free of
__________."
" __________ for our guests is so small," said a producer, "that these shows are inexpensive to put on. And say
what you want about good taste, millions watch us every day, and as long as the ratings are that healthy, sponsors
will pay good money to be identified with us."

A Visit to the President
In the winter of 1941, Enrico Fermi and a number of other distinguished scientists importuned President Franklin
Roosevelt for authorization to begin an all-out effort in atomic energy research. The scientists were alarmed by
incontrovertible evidence of surreptitious German experiments, and they asked for speedy approval. Italian-born
Enrico Fermi was the ideal man to lead the atomic research. Already in 1938 he had won the Nobel Prize for work
with radioactive elements and neutron bombardment. Fermi had found a haven from the Fascists (his wife was
Jewish) and he knew that if the Germans were the first to develop an atomic bomb it would mean that Hitler could
subjugate the entire world. The international race for atomic supremacy was on.

The Ultimate Weapon Takes Shape
Enrico Fermi designed a device that could eventuate in a chain reaction. It consisted of layers of graphite,
alternated with chunks of uranium. The uranium emitted neutrons, and the graphite slowed them down. Holes were
left for long cadmium safety rods. By withdrawing those control rods Fermi could speed up the production of
neutrons, thus increasing the number of uranium atoms that would be split (fission). When the rods were
withdrawn to a critical point, then the neutrons would be produced so fast that the graphite and cadmium could not
absorb them. In that manner a chain reaction would result. Slowly, Fermi's first atomic pile began to grow in a
subterranean room at Columbia University. The big question remainedwas it viable?

reached. Three brave young men jeopardized their lives by ascending* the pile, ready to cover it with liquid
cadmium if anything went wrong. Almost fifty scientists and several incredulous observers mounted a balcony to
watch. One physicist remained on the floor; it was his job to extract the final cadmium control rod. Unbearable
tension permeated the atmosphere. Fermi completed his calculations, waited for a propitious moment, and then
gave the signal.

The Italian Navigator Lands
The chain reaction took place precisely as Enrico Fermi had surmised. After twenty-eight minutes he curtailed the
experiment, giving the signal to replace the control rod. The normally reserved scientists, unable to repress their
excitement, let out a tremendous cheer and gathered around Fermi to shake his hand. Although it was time to
celebrate, some of the men remarked soberly that "the world would never be the same again." On December 2,
1942, the news of Fermi's achievement was relayed in a cryptic telephone message:
"The Italian Navigator has reached the New World."
"And how did he find the natives?"
"Very friendly."

Drug Smugglers Beware
The
__________ message came to Officer Matt Jagusak: "Drug search tomorrowbring pig."
Jagusak, with the Union County New Jersey Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue Unit, had to
__________
his superiors to put Ferris E. Lucas, a super sniffer, to work. Lucas is a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig with a fantastic
olfactory sense that is one million times greater than a human's and could be our

breaking up the drug trade.
A canine trainer offered the pig to Union City, suggesting that its intelligence and unique skill will make Lucas a
__________ fighter against illegal narcotics. Jagusak has already taught his 55-pound porker-detective how to
find cocaine, hashish, and marijuana. While some law enforcement officials were
__________ at first, they
quickly became believers when they saw the Sherlock Holmes of the sty locate underground drug scents that had
eluded trained dogs.
"I don't care if it's a dog, a pig, or an elephant," Jagusak's boss said. "If it benefits the department and our
community, we'll try it."

Sunday Morning at Pearl Harbor
At breakfast time on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, Dorie Miller was serving coffee aboard the battleship
West Virginia. Dorie was black, and the highest job to which he could then aspire in the U.S. Navy was that of
messman. While Dorie was technically a member of a great fighting fleet, he was not expected to fight. Most
Army and Navy officers inveighed against blacks as fighting men. Although blacks were nettled by such overt
prejudice, Dorie Miller apparently accepted being relegated to the role of a messhall servant. Now, as he poured
the coffee, Dorie was wondering why the airplanes above were making so much noise on a peaceful Sunday
morning.

The Infamous* Attack
The coffee cups suddenly went spinning as an explosion knocked Dorie Miller flat on his back. Jumping up from
his supine position, the powerfully built messman from Waco, Texas, headed for the deck. Everywhere that Dorie
looked he saw smoke and mammoth warships lying on their sides. Overhead dozens of Japanese dive bombers
controlled the skies without a U.S. plane to repulse their attack. The havoc was enormous. Without hesitating,
Dorie joined a team that was feeding ammunition to a machine gunner who was making an ineffectual* attempt to
protect their battleship from being razed by the torpedo planes.

The Heroism of Dorie Miller
Men all around Miller were succumbing* to the lethal spray of Japanese bullets. He dragged his captain to safety
and turned back to see that the machine-gunner had been killed. Dorie took the big gun and trained it on the
incoming bombers. Within the space of ten minutes he was credited with destroying four bombers while dodging
the bullets of their fighter escorts. The enemy scurried away, having struck the incisive blow that precipitated U.S.
entrance into World War II. Amidst the dead bodies and the ruined fleet were the heroes such as Dorie Miller. The
Navy had told him that he did not have to fight but he hadn't listened. The Navy had attempted to stereotype him,
but Dorie changed all that.

Some months later Dorie Miller was serving on an aircraft carrier when Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Commander

presented Miller with the prestigious* Navy Cross, commending him for a singular act of valor and "disregard for
his own personal safety." Miller's heroism helped to shatter the bias against African-Americans in the armed

Danny Escobedo Goes to Jail
In 1960, a young Chicagoan, Danny Escobedo, was given a 20-year jail sentence for first-degree murder. Danny
had confessed to complicity in the killing of his brother-in-law after the police had refused to allow him to see his
lawyer. Actually, Danny was tricked into blaming a friend for the liquidation of his sister's husband, thereby
establishing himself as an accomplice. Despite the fact that Danny later recanted his confession, he was found
culpable and jailed. Danny had been stereotyped* as a hoodlum and nobody raised an eyebrow over the hapless*
felon's* troubles.

Escobedo's Lawyer Appeals
Barry Kroll, a Chicago lawyer, took an interest in Danny Escobedo's case. Kroll felt that his client's rights under
the Constitution had been abrogated. Since the alleged accomplice,* Escobedo, had been denied access to an
attorney, Kroll asked the courts to invalidate the conviction. He proposed that lawyers be entitled to sit in when the
police question a suspect but the Illinois courts rejected that on the grounds that it would effectively preclude all
questioning by legal authorities. If such a law were upheld, the police felt that it would play havoc* with all
criminal investigations.

An Historic Supreme Court Ruling
Lawyer Kroll persevered in his defense of Danny Escobedo. The case was argued before the Supreme Court, and in
1964, in a landmark decision, the Court reversed Danny's conviction. Legal aid, said the judges, must be instantly
available to a suspect. "A system of law enforcement that comes to depend on the confession," one Justice
declared, "will, in the long run, be less reliable than a system that depends on extrinsic evidence independently
secured through skillful investigation." A Justice who declaimed against the decision said, however, "I think the
rule is ill-conceived and that it seriously fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal enforcement."

The Effects of the Escobedo Decision
After Danny Escobedo's release from prison, hundreds of inmates began suits for their freedom on the grounds that
their rights had been violated, too. Each case was heard on its merits, and in numerous instances people who had
been convicted of serious offenses were freed because of the new standards established in the Escobedo case. After
getting out, Danny was not a paragon of virtue, according to the police. He led a nomadic existence, drifting from
job to job, and was arrested frequently. With asperity, and a few choice epithets, Danny referred to police
harassment.* Although the Escobedo case was a controversial one, most agree that it inspired better police
training, better law enforcement procedures, and improved scientific crime detection.

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
Questionable Advertisements
The Nostalgia Factory, a Boston art gallery, staged an exhibit of advertisements that had outraged various segments
of the community. For example, one of the fast food chains ran a TV commercial that showed unattractive school
cafeteria workers in hairnets, making that experience less tasty than a visit to Roy Rogers. Another ad that drew
criticism from psychiatrists and groups such as the Alliance for the Mentally Ill suggested to readers that, if they
had paid $100 for a dress shirt, they were fit candidates for a straitjacket. Similar sensitivity had restricted ad
writers from using terms such as "nuts" or "crazy."
Why such protests and where do they come from? Who is asking companies to
__________ contracts with
those agencies that are
__________ in creating racist types of commercial messages? Parents who took
exception to the Burger King spot that announced, "Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules," said no to it because it
gave the wrong message to their children. And when a potato chip maker's ad featured a "bandito," angry
Mexican-Americans used some choice
__________ in denouncing such a stereotype.
The conclusion to be reached is that segments of the population have become increasingly vocal about "insensitive"
ads, demanding that corporations
__________ and never again commission advertisements that are clearly
_________ , provocative, and harmful to good human relationships.

Meet the Bees
One of the most interesting inhabitants of our world is the bee, an insect that is indigenous to all parts of the globe
except the polar regions. The honeybee is a gregarious insect whose habitat is a colony that he shares with as
many as 80,000 bees. Although the individual bees live for only a few days, their colony can be operative for
several years. A cursory study of the activities of these insects reveals an orderliness and a social structure that is
truly amazing. For example, bees in a particular hive have a distinct odor; therefore, when an interloper seeks
access* they can identify him quickly and repulse* his invasion.

Queens, Workers, Drones
Each colony of honeybees consists of three classes: a) the queen who is a prolific layer of eggs; b) the worker who
is the bulwark of the colony; and c) the sedentary drone whose only function is to mate with a young queen. The
queen lays the eggs that hatch into thousands of female workers; some queens live as long as five years and lay up
to one million eggs. The frugal worker builds and maintains the nest, collects and stores the honey, and is the
antithesis of the lazy drone, or male honeybee, who does not work and has no sting. When the drone is no longer
needed, the workers, in effect, liquidate* him by letting him starve to death. It's a cruel, cruel world!

Spotlight on the Worker
Let us examine the activities of the altruistic workers in greater detail. After the workers have constructed a hive of
waterproof honeycomb (made from beeswax), the queen begins to lay eggs in the first cells. While some workers
embellish the hive, others fly out in search of nectar and pollen. With their long tongues they gather nectar and use
their hind legs to carry the pollen from the flowers. They fly directly back to the hive and then dance around the
honeycomb, their movements indicating the direction of the flowers. Meanwhile, other workers have been cleaning
cells, caring for the young, and guarding the precious cache of nectar. Another special coterie is entrusted with
heating or cooling the hive. Dedicated to the welfare of the queen and the entire insect community, all of these
workers display a complete absence of cupidity.

The Saga of the Queen Bee
Although the virtuosity of the workers is remarkable, the queen bee is really the main story. Workers choose a few
larvae to be queens, feeding them royal jelly, a substance rich in proteins and vitamins. While the queen is
changing from a larva to a pupa, a team of workers builds a special cell for her. Soon the young queen hatches,
eats the prepared honey, and grows strong. After she kills any rivals who have the temerity to challenge her, an
amorous note is injected. She flies from the hive and mates with one or more drones on her first flight. Then the
process of egg laying begins. When her progeny saturate the hive, scouts are dispatched to find a new location, and
the bees swarm after their leader to begin the amazing cycle again.

Cheating a Cheater
''Our neighborhood was so tough," the comedian joked, "that two guys held up a bank and were mugged as they

Mr. D., the gang kingpin in our community, loved money. Like Silas Marner, the
__________ weaver of
George Eliot's novel, he enjoyed counting his treasure each Friday night. Mr. D's

a wall safe behind a painting in his office. The $50 and $100 bills made his hands dirty as he counted them but Mr.
D didn't mind. The filth of the lucre did not disturb him at all.
One Friday evening, Roy continued, a brash

subterfuge which British officers concocted is the subject of Ewen Montagu's classic, The Man Who Never Was. In

have his body recovered by agents who would transmit the false information to Germany, and then observe the

"Major Martin" Goes to War
After Commander Montagu and his colleagues had been given official approval for their dangerous escapade, they
encountered manifold problems. First, they conducted an assiduous search for a body that looked as though it had
recently been killed in an airplane disaster. Then, a detailed history of the man had to be invented that would be so
impeccable that the enemy would accept its authenticity. This meant documents, love letters, personal effects, keys,
photographs, etc. Each step was fraught with difficulty, but the schemers were unbelievably resourceful. As a
result, in the late spring of 1942, "Major Martin" was prepared to do his part for his country.

week.
Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in an
__________ review of Social Security disability
payments, focused on Jack Benson, a
__________ Seattle panhandler. Mr. Benson had claimed that whatever
money he collects on the street can be compared to the funds raised by legitimate charities, and, therefore, he is
entitled to a federal deduction. Government officials regard his analogy as
__________ and disagree. It is their
contention that, since Benson's income is unearned, it should be subtracted from his disability payments.
Mr. Benson may not be highly regarded as a street beggar but that didn't stop him from going into the Federal
District Court in Oregon to plead that his appeals for cash are an art form, thereby making him eligible for most of
the $472 a month that he had been receiving. Not so, declared the government, quoting from a 1990 ruling that
found that "money received through begging is better classified as 'gifts' rather than as 'wages' or 'net earnings
from self-employment.'"
Mr. Benson's lawyer, plunging into the legal
__________, has not given up. She countered that, if Jack merely
sat on a street corner with his hand out, the government had a good case. However, in her words, "Jack Benson is a
__________ professional who has elevated begging to a respectable level because of his skill in actively
seeking contributions."
It may take all of Benson's talent as a salesman to get the government to put some money in his collection basket.

Chimpanzees Are Surprisingly Smart
Washoe, the chimpanzee, has more than a veneer of intelligence; she can signal her desire to eat, go in or out, be
covered, or brush her teeth. In addition, she can make signs for "I'm sorry," "I hurt," "Hurry," ''Give me," and a
myriad of other terms that are familiar to young children. This urbane animal can indicate that she craves more

("sweet"). It is irrelevant that Washoe cannot actually talk. What is important, however, is the consummate* ease

More Facts About Chimps
Chimps in the laboratory have demonstrated their ability to find their way out of the most tortuous maze. They can
press buttons, manipulate levers, avoid shocks, etc. When food is placed out of reach, the animals can prepare a
ladder of boxes to reach it. In his natural habitat* the chimpanzee is something of an itinerant. He goes his
nomadic* way through the jungle, living on fruit, insects, and vegetables. With the aid of his long, powerful hands
he can swing rapidly from tree to tree and cover considerable ground in his peregrinations. Chimps are loyal in
their conjugal relationships, taking only one mate at a time. That may be another barometer of these animals'
superior intelligence.

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
A Shameful Situation
The plight of the migrant farm worker continues to frustrate the U.S. Labor Department, court officials, legislators,
religious groups, and community agencies. Men, women, and children toil six and seven days a week to earn as
little as $5 to $10 a week after being overcharged for their food, medicine, and basic living needs. They are housed
in ramshackle dormitories, often with non-functioning toiletsa
__________ of their employers' contempt for
them; they lack hot water and showers, and are given food that is barely fit for human consumption.
Unscrupulous contractors scour the countryside in search of homeless,
__________, and unemployed men and
women, offering to put them to work at good jobs picking fruits and vegetables. The U.S. Labor Department
investigates the
__________ of complaints of abused workers, issues fines, and revokes the licenses of
contractors. But many such shady employers pay the fines (which they
__________ to be operating expenses)
and continue to run company stores that cheat the workers, subjugate them with drugs and alcohol,
__________
them with advances on their paltry wages at high interest, and use violence against those whom they regard as
troublemakers.
Fred Jones, a typical migratory worker from South Carolina, claims to have worked for $6 cash out of his $158
check. His story is repeated by hundreds of others who have been treated shabbily by corrupt contractors. Until
sufficient funds are allocated by state and federal agencies, and until there is the proper public response, these
abuses will continue.

Trouble in Ruritania
King Andre of Ruritania was afflicted* with megalomania, and the people of his country suffered, as a result. After

In order to improve Ruritania's financial position, an astute* but parsimonious treasurer was installed and given

Disappointment and Dedication
When Prince Schubert asked for additional restrictive measures, the people began to balk. Speaking on radio, the
young reformer explained the reasons for higher taxes and food rationing; he was blunt when he stated the need for
personal sacrifices. Nevertheless, the resistance to reform was great, and nostalgia for the "good old days" of King
Andre began to grow. The people admitted that graft and corruption had been rife under Andre, but at least
"everybody got his slice of the pie." Although Prince Schubert was tempted to quit, he determined that he would

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
Ogopogo
Accounts of supersized creatures such as the Loch Ness Monster and the Abominable Snowman are
__________ . Despite the lack of hard evidence, some people continue to believe that the depths of our lakes and
isolated mountain caves remain the dwelling places of fantasy figures.
Now, a new star for the credulous has surfaced. Japanese television was asked to
__________ a search for
Ogopogo, a long-necked reptilian creature said to inhabit Lake Okanagan in the mountains of south-central British
Columbia. Ogopogo stories are
__________ in that area as people produce photos of rippling water and
shadows resembling an enormous serpent with flippers, gliding slowly in large circles.
Those who
__________ at what they regard as nonsense and pagan superstition are quite
__________ in
belittling Ogopogo fans. Nevertheless, the legends, which have a life of their own, happily, have brought thousands
of tourists and business to the Okanagan Valley.
Recognition of the creature now exists in British Columbia's environmental law which provides protection for
Ogopogo. The official description reads, ''An animal in Okanagan Lake, other than a sturgeon, that is more than
three meters in length, and the mates or offspring of that animal."
Been wondering about the creature's name? Ogopogo comes from an English music hall song: "His mother was an
earwig; his father was a whale; a little bit of head and hardly any tailand Ogopogo was his name."

The Roach Lives On
Cockroaches are the oldest extant winged insects, having been traced back over 350 million years. They have
endured the vicissitudes of weather, natural disasters, war, and planned liquidation.* They reside comfortably in
caves in South America, in transcontinental airplanes, on mountain tops, in Park Avenue edifices, and in television
sets. The climate may be sultry or frigid but roaches persevere.* In the words of one writer, "The miraculous
survival of the roach is explained by its inherent* adaptability." In fact, a trenchant analysis made the point that
any forthcoming nuclear war will be won by roaches, not Russians, Chinese, or Americans.

Since the average female produces close to three hundred descendants, little hope is held out for a final solution to

Prince Siddhartha Gautama was the scion of a family of warrior-kings in northern India. He was being

paintingwhile lavishing fulsome praise upon him. It wasn't until the prince was thirty that he took the first step that
led to his becoming the Buddha, one of the world's greatest spiritual leaders.

constantly afflicted.* Retiring to his room to ponder over what he had seen, he remained there for several days,
deaf to the supplication of those who pleaded with him to come forth. It seemed to Siddhartha that his life had
been redolent* with decadence, and he was determined to make amends.

The Enlightened One
Siddhartha exchanged his sumptuous* garments for a monk's yellow robe and went out into the world to do
penance for what he considered to be his previous life of sin. First he would cleanse himself by becoming an
ascetic; then he would study Hindu wisdom in order to be prepared to help his suffering people. After six years of
desultory wandering and attracting only a handful of disciples, Siddhartha came to a huge tree near the Indian city
of Gaya. For seven weeks he sat beneath its branches, seeking an answer for his personal torment. Finally, it is
said, he underwent a metamorphosis, becoming the Enlightened Onethe Buddha.

Love Over Hatred, Goodness Over Evil
Buddha outlined the three paths that men might travel: worldly pleasure, self-torment, and the middle path. Only
through the middle path could man achieve bona fide peace and salvation. One had to repudiate* materialism, keep
his self-control, restrict speech, be open-minded, never lie or steal, reject selfish drives, nurture goodness, etc.
Buddha continued to preach until the age of eighty, spreading the philosophy that man has the power to shape his
own destiny. Through good deeds and pure thoughts man may reach nirvana. Interestingly enough, the man who
objected to traditional religious worship was to become idolized by millions throughout the world.

History's Most Extraordinary Person?
In a celebrated essay about Joan of Arc, Mark Twain wrote movingly of her brief moment in the spotlighttwo short
years in which she made an indelible mark on world history. At age 16 she was illiterate, had never strayed from
her sleepy little village, knew nothing of military combat, or courts of law. But at age 17, in a complete
__________ she was named Commander-in-Chief of the French army, vowing to restore her king to his throne.
Joan attracted many fervent followers, and a
__________ called her "France's
__________ ."
After much gallantry in battle, this
__________ heroine was brought low by treachery at the French court and
captured by the enemy. Joan defended herself brilliantly at a court trial, although she could neither read nor write.
She was able to forecast future events with remarkable accuracy, correctly predicting her own martyrdom.
Mark Twain understood how geniuses such as Napoleon, Edison, and Wagner could develop but one could
__________ the facts for a lifetime without being able to explain how this humble peasant girl could display the
qualities of a mature statesman, a learned jurist, and a military wizard. He concluded:
"Taking into account her origin, youth, sex, illiteracy, early environment, and the obstructing conditions under
which she exploited her high gifts and made her conquests in the field and before the courts that tried her for her
lifeshe is easily and by far the most extraordinary person the human race has ever produced."

A Profile of the Woman Who Drinks to Excess
The typical alcoholic woman is above average in intelligence, in her forties, married, with two children. She started
drinking socially in high school or college. Although frequently incapacitated, she can fabricate a story skillfully
and thus conceal her true physical condition. She often attributes her alcoholism to connubial stress, boredom, or
depression. A large percentage of the women give family histories of alcoholism. Most female drinkers would
demur at the appellation of "alcoholic"and that makes their treatment all the more difficult.
Important Note: How good a detective are you? Did you spot one of the new words that had been introduced
earlier? (fabricate) It should be part of your vocabulary now. From time to time in the lessons that follow, your

They also indict* social acceptance and indifference to alcohol's potential danger as contributory factors. If women
realized the harmful extent of the cumulative effect of alcohol, they might taper off in their public and recondite
drinking. Forty-three percent of the female alcoholics in a survey showed evidence of liver damage, and a quarter
of the whole group had a high white-blood-cell count. Almost five percent of the patients died shortly after their
release from the hospital.

Hair Today, . . .
The fact that a hair salon might charge $40 for a woman's shampoo and haircut but only $20 for the same services
for a man is a matter of
__________ to most citizens. Not so to New York City's Commission on Human
Rights, which claimed that such a disparity is discriminatory. Commissioner Dennis De Leon has targeted ''gender-
based" pricing as a violation of city law.
Consider the
__________ of the salon owners. They
__________ the price difference, explaining that it takes
much longer to cut a woman's hair and requires the use of additional products. But a spokesperson for the
Department of Consumer Affairs said that beauty parlors will have to
__________ with the situation honestly,
just as dry cleaners and used-car dealers did when they were apprised of the law.
"I know that women are fighting for equality," said the owner of a chain of unisex hair salons, "but this is
ridiculous. We cut a man's hair in no time but we have to get more money from our female customers because their
styling and cutting takes so much longer."
The argument might be the
__________ to an important court case. A city-proposed settlement, however, is to
have those salons that are cited for violations of the law offer free haircuts to women for a period of three months
before having to pay a stiff fine for repeated offenses.
"It's easier to comply," shrugged one owner (bald, himself).

Ellis Sloane, a teacher of science at a large metropolitan high school, first paid little attention to the fact that his

heterogeneous, with youngsters' names running the gamut from Adams to Zilch. But Biology 121 had only A's and
B's, whereas Biology 128 had T's, V's, W's, Y's, and Z's. Mr. Sloane, a perspicacious teacher, began to perceive*

The Perils of the Alphabet
Dr. Weston is convinced that the pedagogue is the culprit.* Since teachers seat their pupils in alphabetical order,
the "S" to "Z" child is usually the last to receive his test marks, the last to eat lunch, the last to be dismissed, and
so on. As they are the last to recite, these youngsters feel frustrated* because what they had to say had usually
been enunciated earlier. The inordinate amount of waiting that this group has to do causes them to become
irascible and jittery. "S" to "Z" people also become quite introspective, convinced that they are inferior to those at
the top of the alphabet.

Microsociety-An Antidote for School Boredom
Money, taxes, employment, legislationthese are topics that we associate with the adult world. George Richmond, a
Yale graduate who became a
__________ in the New York City school system, felt that elementary school
youngsters could also be interested, even excited, about such issues. He experimented in his own classes with the
Microsociety in which basic instruction takes place and is reinforced as pupils operate their own businesses, pass
laws, live within the parameters of a constitution that they drafted, seek redress within their own judicial system,
buy and sell real estate, and so on.
Richmond's book on the Microsociety came to the attention of the school board in Lowell, Massachusetts, and their
members decided to give it a try in 1981. In much less than a
__________ the results were quite remarkable:
students exceeded the norm in reading and math; 8th graders passed college level exams; school attendance went
up to 96%; and the dropout rate took a nosedive in Lowell.
In Microsociety's
__________ classes, mornings are given over to the traditional curriculum. In the afternoon,
the students apply what they learned in activities that run the
__________ from keeping double entry books,
doing financial audits, running a bank, and conducting court sessions to engaging in light manufacture that leads to
retail and wholesale commerce.
Other
__________ school systems have since adopted George Richmond's innovative ideas. "Microsociety,"
said a Yonkers, New York principal, "gets kids to role-play life!"
A Time Magazine reporter was much impressed with Microsociety's results: "Such an approach would go a long
way toward making U.S. public schools a cradle of national renewal."

Primitive Magic
In the course of their studies of other cultures, anthropologists have reported numerous customs and practices that
seem bizarre to the average American. Many primitive people believe that certain inanimate objects have a will of
their own and possess some magical powers. These fetishes may be simple things like a particular feather of a bird
or a unique pebble. The fetish might have derived its power, according to members of some tribes, from a god who
lives within the object and has changed it into a thing of magic. Fetishes need not only be natural objects,
however. An artifact such as a sculpture or carving is also believed to possess supernatural powers.
Sample Sentences
Now use your new words in the following sentences.
1. Stones are __________ objects that have no life of their own.
2. It has been suggested that the man who builds a better mousetrap will find the world beating a path to his door
to possess this __________.
3. The explorers saw the golden statue and thought of how much money it would bring them. But their lives would
be in danger if they moved it because it was a powerful __________ to the natives.
4. Margaret Mead, the famous __________, fascinated thousands of readers with her studies of South Seas
islanders.
5. It would be rather __________ for a young man to come to school wearing a dress.

Forbidden
An outgrowth of the idea of a fetish* is the closely related practice of taboo. Whereas the gods or supernatural
powers merely inhabit an object that is a fetish and lend it magic, they will punish the imprudent native who
violates their prohibition of an act or use of an object or word that has become taboo. If a taboo has been broken,
it becomes imperative for the offender to be punished. In many cases, however, the taint on the community may be
removed after the priests have performed a special ceremony. Often, the violator of the taboo will be punished or
die merely through his own fears of the terrible thing he has done.

An Absurdity
Although it is probably universal human behavior to be contemptuous of the bizarre* superstitions practiced by
inhabitants of unfamiliar cultures, it seems to be somewhat imprudent* to laugh at others before one takes a good,
hard look at the absurd taboos* and fetishes* one accepts as part of one's everyday life. Isn't it somewhat absurd
when the "dyed-in-the-wool" bigot, who illogically fears the taint* of close association with blacks (behavior that
resembles fear of a taboo), spends most of the summer lying in the sun trying to acquire the color he claims to
abhor? Since doctors tell us that excessive sun-tanning may be a cause of skin cancer, our strange yearning for
sun-darkened skin has all the qualities of a fetish.*

During the Middle Ages most people believed that the devil could enter our bodies when we sneezed, because at
that propitious* moment we left our bodies vulnerable. However, this catastrophic* event could be avoided if
another person immediately made an entreaty to God. This was how the practice began of saying ''God bless you"
after someone sneezes. Although the tradition continues today, few people are aware of its history. A superstition
originates in ignorancewhen people are unsure of the causes of events. But it continues inviolable over the years
because it usually represents our deepest fears.

And today it's time to strengthen your word knowledge again. You've noticed, of course, that the matching
definitions are not always the definitions you may have been familiar with. This is the way language works. It is

The Explosion of Krakatoa
There are few sights that are more impressive and awesome than the eruption of an active volcano. There are few
natural events that so singularly* dwarf man's puny attempts to control his environment. Perhaps the greatest
volcanic eruption of modern times took place in 1883 when the island of Krakatoa in Indonesia blew up as the
result of a volcanic explosion. An enormous tidal wave resulted that proved catastrophic* to the nearby coasts of
Java and Sumatra. New islands were formed by the lava that poured out, and debris was scattered across the Indian
Ocean for hundreds of miles. Volcanic material, dispersed seventeen miles into the atmosphere, created startlingly
beautiful sunsets for years afterwards.

Man's ability to obliterate life on this planet has increased at a rapid rate. We are now faced with the deplorable
prospect of new weapons that can cause destruction of life and property on a scale far beyond our imagination. No
matter who takes the first step to initiate a conflict, the possibility exists that the conflagration will spread and
envelop the world. Much thought has been given to ways and means of preventing this catastrophe.* Some
consider it mandatory* that the nuclear powers seek agreement on methods of limiting and controlling these

Taken for Granted
The presence of an ever-flowing supply of fresh, clean water is taken for granted. Unfortunately, this congenial
condition is fast disappearing. As our population increases, as industry consumes more water each year, the level
of our underground water supply sinks measurably. There is no way to hoard water; there are many ways to
conserve it. During a particularly dry spell, New York City found its reservoirs going dry. Only then did the
residents begin to heed the sage advice to limit the wasteful uses of water. Under the aegis of the Water
Commissioner, citizens were encouraged to develop habits that would save water. The continued imprudent* waste
by each of us of this most basic resource will work to the detriment of all.

An Ageless Story
Every so often we can read about a man or woman who has reached an age far beyond the limits we ordinarily
expect. Reports of a man in Chile or a woman in Turkey who has celebrated the 105th or 110th birthday occur
regularly. The natural question is, to what do these people owe their longevity? Frequently, the answer concerns the
fact that the ancient one liked to imbibe regularly of some hard liquor. The photograph will show an apparently
virile man or robust woman. Somehow, people who reach this advanced age seem to remain eternally sturdy. There
are no signs that they have become senile. Smoking a pipe, or sewing on some garment, these rare specimens of
hardy humanity are far from the doddering folk we expect to see.

The Lack of Foreign News
The critics rebuke the press for the fact that most newspapers devote somewhat less than 10 percent of their news
space to foreign items. In many hundreds of papers this falls below two percent. Why is there this aversion to
foreign news? Newsmen claim that readers evince no interest in foreign affairs. In order to increase reader interest
in foreign news, the vogue among editors is to sensationalize it to the point of distortion. Many other papers do
only the most superficial kind of reporting in this area.

The average newspaper office receives many times the amount of foreign news than it has space to print. The

should know, are decisive. Because the newspaper owners do not want to endanger a lucrative business, there is
the constant tussle between personal opinion and the desire not to offend too many readers or advertisers. It is
intrinsic to the operation of all mass media that they avoid being extremist in their news coverage or editorials.

A Favorite News Source
The electronic mediatelevision and radiohave more acute problems than does the press when it comes to news
reporting. A normal broadcast can cover only a small part of a news day. The object is to transmit the gist of a
story without supplying its background. Another difficulty of electronic news broadcasting is its transient nature;
the viewers or listeners may miss an important story if their attention wanders. On the other hand, because radio
and television present news in a more terse and exciting way, they are accepted as the most cogent presentation of
news and are preferred and believed above newspapers by most people.

If you've ever watched or played baseball, you know how important a base hit is to each batter. Before the game
players spend as much time as possible taking their batting practice. During the game the batter concentrates on
every pitch. In the same way, each day you are getting in your "batting practice," and the weekly review is your
chance to build up your "batting average." Collect new words with the same concentration that baseball players

A Musical World
Music reached its pinnacle in the nineteenth century. Every leading nation produced its share of great composers.
There was a bewildering array of national schools and musical styles as the once obscure musician came into his
own. Music became a widespread and democratic art. The ardent music lover turned to Vienna as the music center
at the beginning of the nineteenth century. However, Paris was not far behind, especially in the field of operatic
music. As the century progressed, the Germans became paramount* in orchestral and symphonic music. The
growth of German music can be said to have culminated with Ludwig van Beethoven.

Beethoven was able to free music from the traditions* that had tended to constrict it. He was a child prodigy who
held an important musical post at the age of 14. He was a successful concert pianist, but when his health began to
fail he turned to composing. Even though bereft of hearing at the age of 49, he did not falter in his work. Some of

A Worthy Successor
A successor to Beethoven was Johannes Brahms. Also a prodigy,* he was the object of vitriolic attacks by other
composers because of the individuality of his work. They heaped invective upon him for the intensely emotional
quality and Germanic style of his writings. However, it was impossible to besmirch his talents for long, and he was
soon one of the most popular composers in Europe. He produced voluminous varieties of compositions. Today, in
retrospect, his originality is appreciated, and he is placed among the top romantic composers.

In his private life Brahms was considered by his friends as an egotist. He had an extremely lofty opinion of himself
and his talents. He was not noted for his humility. Along with this quality, Brahms was known for his pungent
sense of humor. While his closest friends could accept his biting jokes, others found him difficult to warm up to.
Brahms was an inveterate stay-at-home. Cambridge University conferred an honorary degree upon him, but he was
adamant about staying at home and did not go to receive the honor. Despite the ardent* and romantic nature of his
music, Brahms never found the right girl and remained single throughout his life.

A Dangerous Sport
Racing car drivers are vulnerable to dangers that other sportsmen seldom face. Drivers agree that controlling a car
at top speeds on a winding course is a singularly* awesome* experience. There is the bedlam caused by the roaring
motors that move the car from a standing start to 100 miles an hour in eight seconds. One is shaken by the
cacophony of the brakes, larger than the wheels and producing during the course of a 350-mile race enough heat to
warm an eight-room house through a hard winter. The driver needs to be on the alert to exploit any mistake by an
opponent, and he must be constantly aware of the propinquity of sudden death. All of this makes car racing one of
the most demanding games of all.

The Mystery of Creativity
In order to create, it is said that a man must be disgruntled. The creative individual is usually one who is
dissatisfied with things as they are; he wants to bring something new into the worldto make it a different place.
There is no infallible way to identify a potentially creative person. The speed-up in the sciences has forced schools
and industry to seek a panacea for the shortages that they face. The need to discover and develop the creative

A Sport for Everyone
Of the many highly popular sports in the United States, football must be rated around the top. This sport allows the
speedy and lithe athlete to join with the slower and obsese one in a team effort. The skills and strengths of many
men are welded together so that one team may work as a unit to gain mastery over its opponent. The
knowledgeable adherent of a team can follow action covering many parts of the playing field at the same time. He
is in a state of bliss when his team executes a movement to perfection. However, there is no one more pathetic than
the same fan when the opposition functions to equal perfection.

The spectators at a football game play more than a superficial* role. A spirited cheer from the stands often gives
the player on the field a reason to try even harder. Cheer leaders exhort the fans, who may be in a state of apathy
because their team is losing, to spur on the team. In particularly close games between rivals of long standing,
feelings begin to run high, and from time to time a fracas may break out in the stands. While the teams compete
below, the fan who is a bit inebriated may seek out a personal adversary. On the whole the enthusiasm of the
spectators is usually constricted* to cheering and shouting for their favorite teams.

The 23-Inch Football Field
The football fan who cannot attend a contest in person may watch any number of games on television. This has the
great advantage of permitting an indolent fan to sit in the comfort of his living room and watch two teams play in
the most inclement* weather. However, some of the spirit, the gusto, is missing when one watches a game on a
small screen away from the actual scene of the contest. Also, the viewer is constantly exposed to a garrulous group
of announcers who continue to chatter in an endless way throughout the afternoon. Should the game be a dull one,
the announcers discuss the most banal bits of information. Even in the poorest game there is constant chatter
involving one platitude after another about the laudable* performances of each and every player.

What's On?
One day each week is set aside for college football, and another for the professional brand. Most fans enjoy both
varieties. Nothing can put an avid* viewer into a pique more quickly than missing an important contest. It is the
dilettante who eschews* the amateur variety and watches only the professional games. The atypical fan will watch
only his home team play; however, enthusiasts will continue to view the most nondescript contests involving teams
that have no connection with their own town or school. Some intrepid* fans have been known to watch high school
games when that was all that was offered. Public interest in football grows each year, while interest in other sports
may be on the wane.

Each Citizen's Obligation
Of all the democracies in the world, the United States has the most lackluster record when it comes to citizen
participation in elections. Every four years the experts try to analyze the reasons for voter
__________. Often
the eligible voter turnout at election time falls below 50%. This, after months of political campaigning, including
televised debates, is a
__________ situation.
No matter how hard the candidates woo the voters, the end results are often disappointing. Are the voters so
__________ that they would rather stay home watching television than cast a ballot? Does the voter feel that the
candidates are stating one
__________ after another and is therefore turned off?
The right to vote is so precious that revolutions have taken place where it has been denied. The civil rights
struggles of the past were sparked by those who had been denied this right. The greatest
__________ of
democracy in this country is said to be the failure of citizen participation in the election process.

In Days Gone By
The man who best described the now extinct life aboard a steamer on the Mississippi River is Mark Twain. Having
actually worked aboard the river boats, his writing captures the tranquil* or turbulent* events of those days. In his
book about life on the Mississippi, Twain recalls the idyllic times when man was not in such a great rush to get
from one place to another. One chapter deals with the races conducted between the swiftest of the boats. When a
race was set, the excitement would galvanize activity along the river. Politics and the weather were forgotten, and
people talked with gusto* only of the coming race. The two steamers "stripped" and got ready; every encumbrance
that might slow the passage was removed. Captains went to extremes to lighten their boats. Twain writes of one
captain who scraped the paint from the gaudy figure that hung between the chimneys of his steamer.

The John J. Roe
Mark Twain's boat was so slow no other steamer would condescend to race with it. With the utmost candor, Twain
comments that his boat moved at such a pathetic* pace, they used to forget in what year it was they left port.
Nothing would mortify Twain more than the fact that ferryboats, waiting to cross the river, would lose valuable
trips because their passengers grew senile* and died waiting for his boat, the John J. Roe, to pass. Mark Twain
wrote in a jocose manner about the races his steamer had with islands and rafts. With quiet humor he continued to
malign the riverboat, but his book is replete* with love for this sort of life.

The Riverboat Pilot
The riverboat pilot was a man considered omnipotent by all. Mark Twain once held that high position. He writes
that he felt at the zenith of his life at that time. Starting out as a fledgling pilot's apprentice, he could not abjure*
dreams of the time he would become, "the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the
earth." Kings, parliaments, and newspaper editors, Twain comments, are hampered and restricted. The river pilot
issued peremptory commands as absolute monarch. The captain was powerless to interfere. Even though the pilot
was much younger than the captain, and the steamer seemed to be in imminent* danger, the older man was
helpless. The captain had to behave impeccably,* for any criticism of the pilot would establish a pernicious*
precedent that would have undermined the pilot's limitless authority.

The Double Cross
Many incidents that took place aboard his ship are re-told by Twain. One has to do with a wealthy cattle man who
was approached by three gamblers. The cattle farmer had let it be known that he had a great deal of money, and the
gamblers were trying to wheedle him into a card game. He protested that he knew nothing about cards. His rustic
appearance confirmed that fact. On the last night before landing the three gamblers got him drunk. When the first
hand was dealt, a jubilant expression came over his face. The betting became furious. All of the proper decorum
was put aside, and ten thousand dollars soon lay on the table. With the last wager one of the gamblers showed a
hand of four kings. His partner was to have dealt the sucker a hand of four queens. At this point the victim, the
charlatan, removed the veneer* of respectability, and showed a hand of four aces! One of the three professional
gamblers was a clandestine* confederate of the "rich cattle farmer." They had been planning this duplicity* for
many weeks.

As the quantity of propaganda becomes greater, ideas are presented in more strident tones in order to overcome the

is one in which the individual retreats into a state of lassitude. He has an aversion* to all attempts to influence him.
So we can see the intrinsic* weakness inherent* in an increased level of propaganda. It has the deleterious result of

Cross My Palm with Silver
People are fascinated by those who say they can predict the future. Fortune tellers continue to attract gullible
customers, and horoscopes are examined daily to see if there is something
__________ to worry about in the
day ahead. One specialist who seems to have found a way to predict something of our future is the palm reader. It
is her belief that a long ''life line" in the hand means the customer will enjoy longevity.
While this appears to be a
__________ way to predict long life, a study done in England measured "life lines"

__________ support for the claim: the length of life matched the length of
line. The longer the line, the older the person lived to be.
However, there are scientists who
__________ with believers in this apparent connection. The "life line" of
older people is longer only because the hand becomes more wrinkled with age. Length of line is a
of length of life, not the reverse, say scientists.

The Library Machine
As automation permeates* many new ideas of life, its effect upon us becomes concomitantly* more profound.
Information processing and communications machines are finding their way into libraries. Here they alleviate the
burden of storing and bringing out to the reader the accumulation of information that is becoming more prodigious
in this era of specialization and threatening to inundate* our already encumbered* library system. As a way to
expedite the selection of pertinent* information for the reader, the machine scans 5,000 words per minute. It is the
celerity of machine reading that makes automation in the library so valuable.

The Language Machine
Those who see the spread of automated machines as a nefarious* force out to usurp the proper functions of
mankind have corroboration* for their belief in the language machine. The paltry handful of expert translators with
a profound* knowledge of many foreign languages leaves a wide gap in our sources of vital information. With
important technological and scientific work being done abroad, it is difficult to condone the situation. A machine
may be set to treat a foreign language as a coded message that it can analyze and put into English. Perhaps it will
not do an impeccable* job, but it will permit the translation of even the most trivial foreign reports and writings.
As bizarre as it might seem, machines are taking over as translators in ever increasing numbers.
Don't look back at the "new words." Did you spot bizarre as a reintroduced word?
Sample Sentences

information about the two teams: speed of the backs, weight of the linemen, past performances of the teams, even
the years served by the venerable coaches was fed into the machine. Extraneous material was avoided. The astute*
computer printed the figure "one" for each team. While this may seem ambiguous to the average person, it

A Formidable Opponent
One of the most interesting tests of a computer's ability to "think" occurred in 1992. The world's chess champion, a
man of
__________ mental ability in this sport, was challenged to compete against the most powerful computer
programmed to play chess. The question was, could a machine
__________ a human's place as the best chess
player in the world?
The match took place before hundreds of chess enthusiasts and was recorded on film. While the computer lacked
the champion's experience and emotional capacity, it worked with such
__________ that it could search ahead
for many thousands of choices, well beyond what any human could envision. In fact, the computer had already
defeated many
__________ chess masters in preparation for the contest.
The result of this test match was
__________ as far as human self-esteem was concerned. The champion won
fairly easily. However, there is almost total agreement that it is only a matter of time before we have an electronic
chess champion, one incapable of making a blunder. At that point it will be checkmate for all of us.

At a Loss
With the trivial* sum of five dollars in his pockets, Robert Lacy was feeling far from complacent about the future.
In fact, it was his somber estimate that no matter how frugal* he was, his money would run out before the next day.
He owed $3.50 in debts to friends; with the remainder he would have to eat enough to maintain his strength.
Hunger would debilitate him to the point where he could not continue his fervid* search for Evelyn. There was no
hope of an impetuous stranger suddenly thrusting money upon him. There was still less solace* for him in the hope
that, after all this time, he might develop the occult power that would give him a mental image of where Evelyn
could be found.

Making Plans
Robert had arrived in New York a week earlier. He had begun by asking discreet questions of Evelyn's former
landlord. There was no need to foment opposition at the very beginning. The landlord was recondite,* and all
Robert had been able to glean from the cryptic* replies was that Evelyn had moved to a residence that catered to
single women. Robert was in a hapless* situation; in this immense city his quarry could be hiding in one of dozens
of such places. This would obviate* the possibility of his dashing from one place to another in an impetuous*
manner. His search, while it had to be concluded with celerity,* could not be carried out in such slovenly fashion.
He required a succinct* and meticulous* plan.

A Newspaper Ad
On the premise* that Evelyn knew she was being sought, Robert's first step was to abjure fruitless* searching and
place an ad in the leading morning newspaper. He would importune* in a most careful way for her return. The ad
read, ''Evelyn. Come out of hiding. I do not reproach you for your actions. I expect no penitent confession. There
is nothing ambiguous* about my offer. Please contact. Robert." He added a box number for a reply. When Robert
went to the paper the next morning, he felt sanguine* about the chances of locating her. His evanescent concerns
disappeared; there was a letter for him, and with tremulous* fingers he tore it open. It contained one sentence, and
it was tantamount to a challenge; "If you really care about me, you will find me by midnight, Friday, Evelyn."

At the Ballet
Evelyn was an anomaly*: she had a propensity for folk music and rock and roll dancing, and, at the same time, she
was an avid* fan of classical ballet. At one time she had been a fledgling* ballet dancer. Robert headed for a
theater where a venerable* ballet company was performing. He knew he had to be wary so that Evelyn might not
see him first. It was Tuesday evening; two days gone with so little to show. Only three more remaining before the
deadline set by Evelyn. He tried hard to allay the sudden fear that came over him that he might not locate her.
Nothing would deter him from succeeding! And so, although he was far from a connoisseur of the dance, he was
standing among the throng* in the lobby, hoping it would be a propitious* evening for him.

Good Enough to Eat?
There seems to be universal agreement that exposure to the ultraviolet light from the sun is deleterious to one's
health. Also, except for tobacco industry spokesmen, there is no dispute about the damage done to us from
cigarette smoke. What is shocking is the fact that almost everything we once regarded as either beneficial, or
harmless, soon gets challenged by scientists. We are urged to
__________ foods that have high fat content.
There go butter and cheese. Even milk has now been added to the list of foods of which we must be
__________ .
Whatever diet we are on, we cannot become
__________ about its nutritional value. We are left, ultimately,
with the
__________ thought that, sooner or later, almost everything we eat or drink may be found to jeopardize
our health.
Given that there are many obstacles to maintaining good health, would it be wise to embrace every new laboratory
report in order to
__________ information? Let's not discard old, proven, sensible food habits. Also, there is
always the possibility that ice cream sundaes will be found to cure baldness, and that chocolate chip cookies will
eliminate our cholesterol problems.

Evelyn. The desk clerk phoned to her room on the pretext* that she had a special delivery letter. Robert waited in
the commodious lobby, replete* with large, antiquated pieces of furniture. He watched from a discreet* distance as

Evelyn Discovered
Failure was imminent,* and Robert was bereft* of hope. It was now Friday. Despite his abstemious* and
parsimonious* way of living, his money had been reduced to a mere pittance. A perverse* impulse brought him to
the section where young people in strange clothing and with uncouth* manners made him recoil* in unmitigated*

dress and behavior. A moment later he saw her! Evelyn! She was sitting at a table in a coffee shop, surrounded by
a coterie* of the most noisome individuals he had ever seen. Evelyn was not incongruous,* for she herself was
unkempt. So this was her new habitat! At that instant Robert knew as an incontrovertible* fact that he had lost her.
With a grimace,* he turned and walked, a doleful* and melancholy figure, toward the bus depot and home.

A Modern Aesop
The telling of a story in simple terms that has an inherently* important message is a venerable* art form. The
parable may be found teaching a moral lesson in the Bible. Aesop is an incontrovertible* master of the fable. This
story form is far from antiquated* as shown by the whimsical approach to life taken by the modern Aesop, James
Thurber. His stories lampoon the strange behavior of his fellow men. Thurber seems unable to countenance the
ideas that permeate* our society regarding the rules by which we should live. Least of all is he able to accept the
sanctimonious notion that some people promulgate* that good always wins out against evil. Thurber's stories often
take an exactly opposite didactic* point of view.
Sample Sentences
Note that some words do not have a one word definition. Frequently, several words, or an entire sentence, is
required.
1. Jonathan Swift was never reticent* to __________ the egotist* in order to bring him down with alacrity.*
2. What one person finds __________, the other may find asinine.*
3. The expression, ''Sour grapes,*" is the gist* of a famous __________ about a fox who couldn't get what he
wanted.
4. We should eschew* our __________ façade;* away with pretext!*
5. If we want to live in a salubrious* milieu,* we can not __________ the noisome* fumes that are deleterious* to
health.
Definitions
Note the distinction between countenance as a noun and as a verb.
6. parable ____ a. humorous, witty
7. whimsical ____ b. hypocritically religious
8. lampoon (v.) ____ c. tolerate,* approve
9. countenance (v.) ____ d. a moralistic story
10. sanctimonious ____ e. ridicule

Modernizing a Parable*
Thurber punctures in an incisive* way the platitudes* that come from stories handed down through the generations.
These old saws are accepted by everyone. One such tale is about a tortoise who had read in an ancient book that a
tortoise had beaten a hare in a race. The sage* old tortoise construed* this story to mean that he could outrun a
hare. With equanimity he hunted for a hare and soon found one. "Do you have the effrontery to challenge me?"
asked the incredulous* hare. "You are a nonentity," he scoffed* at the tortoise. A course of fifty feet was set out.
The other animals gathered around the site*. At the sound of the gun they were off. When the hare crossed the
finish line, the flabbergasted tortoise had gone approximately eight and three-quarter inches. The moral Thurber
draws from this debacle for the tortoise: A new broom may sweep clean, but never trust an old saw.
Which of the five "new words" have you seen before? Answer with equanimity.

Things Have Changed
Thurber modernizes an old story that everyone has read or heard. It has to do with a nefarious* wolf who kept a
vigil* in an ominous* forest until a little girl came along carrying a basket of food for her grandmother. With
alacrity,* this vivacious youngster told the wolf the address to which she was going. Hungry and gaunt the wolf
rushed to the house. When the girl arrived and entered, she saw someone in bed wearing a nightcap and a
nightgown. While the figure was dressed like her grandmother, the little girl surmised* with only a perfunctory*
glance that it didn't have the old lady's mien. She approached and became cognizant* of the hirsute face of the
wolf. She drew a revolver from her purse and shot the interloper* dead. Thurber arrives at a moral for this story
that anyone would find difficult to refute: It is not so easy to fool little girls nowadays as it used to be.
Sample Sentences

Another Surprise
Thurber's stories are written in a jocose* manner, but they contain enough serious matter to make one pensive. He
tells of some builders who left a pane of glass standing upright in a field near a house they were constructing. A
goldfinch flew across the field, struck the glass and was knocked inert.* He rushed back and divulged* to his
friends that the air had crystallized. The other birds derided* him, said he had become irrational,* and gave a
number of reasons for the accident. The only bird who believed the goldfinch was the swallow. The goldfinch
challenged the large birds to follow the same path he had flown. This challenge served to whet their interest, and
they agreed with gusto.* Only the swallow abjured.* The large birds flew together and struck the glass; they were
knocked into a stupor. This caused the astute* swallow to wince with pain. Thurber drew a moral that is the
antithesis* of the cliché we all accept: He who hesitates is sometimes saved.

What makes this form of science fiction so popular? Some may say that each story of the future is a

A Lady Novelist
The nineteenth century saw the woman novelist attain the same prestige* as men. England was prolific* in
producing women writers. One of the foremost in this genre was Charlotte Brontë. In Jane Eyre she presented a
candid portrait of a woman caught up in a clandestine* affair with a married man. Miss Bronte's readers were
engrossed* in this story. She took this unsavory subject and presented it in a way that did not degrade the
relationship. She showed that true passion can be healthy. Miss Brontë did not disparage* Jane's feelings or
besmirch* her character. The author was generous in her verdict. The affair was considered merely a venial sin
because Jane was never false in her feelings or her actions.

14921992
We are all aware that 1992 was the year during which there were
__________ reminders that it marked the

reenactments, there was controversy regarding the lives of those who had been here for many centuries before that
fateful event.
Historical research shows that it would be extremely
__________ to believe that ''civilization" began on this
continent with Columbus' arrival. The Native American tribes had formed nations and had come together in an
organization known as the Five Nations. They had regulations for governance that were the

A Man of Nature
Henry Thoreau attempted to confront the problem and solve the enigma* of how one might earn a living and yet
not become an ignominious* slave to the task. He viewed the industrial revolution with antipathy. Man in a servile
role to extraneous* possessions was a main target of his writings. He believed that one could attain genuine wealth
not by accumulating objects or money, but through enjoyment and perusal* of nature. By his own volition he gave
up friends and comforts for a two year sojourn by himself at Walden Pond. What others might judge as penury,*
was seen by Thoreau as the epitome* of wealth.

The Good Life
Thoreau's book about the austere but happy life at Walden Pond propagated* his fame around the world. He built a
small hut and began living an ascetic* existence. He found it to be a felicitous experience. In this idyllic* setting
he was able to spend his time reading, studying nature, writing, and thinking. Far from being indolent,* he kept
busy in many ways. At the end of the experiment he recalled the halcyon days with pleasure. He believed he had
learned the secret of the truly happy life. The only tenable way of life is one in harmony with nature; material
possessions are superfluous.

The Mind's Secrets
The study of the human mind and behavior has had many prominent practitioners, but no one is more revered* than
Sigmund Freud. An Austrian physician, he is said to be the father of psychoanalysis. He taught that man has a
subconscious mind in which he keeps repugnant* memories that come to the surface surreptitiously* and motivate
behavior. Man often tries to rationalize his actions, when, in reality, they are really the result of suppressed
memories coming to the surface. Freud's approach to the disturbed person was to attempt therapy by examining the
dreams that make cognizant* what the cause of the illness might be. Only with the airing of deleterious, buried
emotions can the person move from the nascent stage to that of full health. Freud was considered an iconoclast in
the field of psychology when his ideas first appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Amateur Psychologists
The ideas of Freudian psychology have become part of our everyday life. Our language is replete* with clichés*
that have their origin in Freud's writings. There is a surfeit* of amateur psychologists who, with celerity,* analyze
an individual's problems from the slightest evidence. Despite their dubious* education and training in this field,
they discuss symptoms and cures on a most erudite fashion. Should a person express a fear of height, this phobia is
examined; events from childhood are considered germane to the problem. Is it possible he or she was dropped as
an infant? Perhaps something in a dream is pertinent* to explain the feelings of vertigo that accompany height. For
some reason, non-trained people find the Freudian approach to the workings of the human mind most conducive to
their practicing as amateur psychologists.

week.
Make My Ostrich Burger Well Done
Just about 100 years ago, there arose an industry in the state of Arizona that seems very odd to us today. We know
of cattle ranches and sheep ranches, but would you believe . . . ostrich ranches? This
__________ business
became popular as women found ostrich feathers a
__________ addition to their wardrobes.
Ostriches are easy to raise. They eat and drink less than cattle, and their eggs are large enough to feed ten people!
During the
__________ days of ostrich ranching, feathers were sold for as much as $300 a pound, so it is easy
to see why that business was so attractive.
However, women's fashions changed after World War I, and the market for ostrich plumes fell. Growers had to
__________ a shrinking market. The price tumbled to about $10 for a bird. As ostrich feathers became
__________ in the fashion world, ostrich ranching came to an end.
Interestingly enough, ostrich ranchers may be coming back into vogue because nutritionists tell us that ostrich meat
is low in cholesterol. We may not go wild over the feathers, but pass the lean meat, please. Hold the mayo, too.

The Enigma* of Fashion
Of all the pressures young people face, the most pernicious* is that of fashion. By this is meant the current vogue*
in dress. The teenagers, who are so glib when they speak of "individuality," are turned into a homogeneous mass by
the latest craze in fashion. How can youngsters who vehemently* resist advice from the older generation become
so malleable in the hands of those who "make" fashion? Perhaps the sudden shifts in fashion occur fortuitously*.
Or is there some group who, through legerdemain, switches styles and customs on us right before our eyes?
Today's teenagers seem to be quite gullible* when it comes to embracing the latest trend in fashions. But then, they
have their elders as sage* examples to follow.

purchase these designs. The fashion industry is cognizant* of the fact that fashions must change rapidly and often
or their economy would become stagnant. For this industry it would prove fatal if it were not vigilant* and
prepared well in advance for a new fashion trend.* As the old fashion becomes passé and a new fashion seems to
be in the making, the garment manufacturers cannot afford to procrastinate. They rush large sums of money into
production for a mass market. Having invested heavily, the manufacturers do everything possible to influence and

Once the fashion industry has been able to foist a new style on the teenager, the older generation tends to

from a new style of dress result from the propensity* of their elders to disparage* them. The actual situation is that
the clothing fashions soon become accepted by all; there is nothing upsetting or revolutionary about them. While

A Famous Mutiny
One of the most repugnant* names in popular legend is that of Captain William Bligh. He was the captain of the
H.M.S. Bounty in 1789, and the mutiny that erupted* aboard that ship was the basis for a film in which Charles
Laughton portrayed Bligh as an awesome* bully and an unmitigated* villain. He would flay both the body and the
spirit of anyone who crossed him. The crew developed such an aversion* to Bligh's mortifying actions and
demeanor that, led by Fletcher Christian, they set the captain and 17 shipmates off in a lifeboat in the South
Pacific. The ship continued to the Pitcairn Islands where the crew remained to live with the islanders. Laughton's
delineation of Bligh remains as the image we have of him. Only recently has any attempt been made to vindicate
Captain Bligh and to remove the heinous reputation that permeates* history.

Fair Play!
Recently, there has been an attempt to improve Captain Bligh's tainted* image. Historians maintain that there was
no turpitude in Bligh's actions aboard the H.M.S. Bounty. Perhaps he was imprudent* in failing to keep his temper
under control. While an infraction aboard ship was quickly criticized, Bligh never carried out those callous actions
the movie dramatized in order to depict* an evil man, say his defenders. After the mutiny, Captain Bligh astutely*

they do request a more benevolent* attitude toward this traditionally* reprehensible* figure, and an end to the
vituperation heaped upon him for these many years.

week.
Psst . . . Need World Series Tickets?
Think about this for a moment. Is there anything wrong in buying something for one dollar and reselling it for two
dollars? Naturally, you would be correct if you saw nothing amiss with this transaction; it's the way a capitalist
economy works. But, if you bought a ticket to a rock concert or baseball game for ten dollars and sold it for
twenty, you would be committing an
__________ of the law. You might ask, "What's so
__________ about
this?" The answer is that you would be guilty of the practice known as "scalping." Does an individual who offers a
scarce ticket at a price above the original price deserve the
__________ connected with the word ''scalping"?
These hard-working and risk-taking individuals see themselves as go-betweens in a world where people are
willing to spend additional money for a popular event. However, law enforcement officials remain
__________
in the face of all reason as they arrest and fine these enterprising salesmen. Those
__________ believers in
punishing law-breakers find nothing wrong with trying to halt the scalping of tickets. For others, it is a way of
doing business that they claim hurts no one and is in keeping with a profit-driven economy.

A Political Show
There are few forms of entertainment more enjoyable than watching a glib* politician run for office. Most
politicians have prepared speeches dealing with the prevalent* topics of the day. They can maintain a fervid* flow
of rhetoric for hours at a time. In each locality where he is to appear, the advance work is prepared by a clique of
trustworthy aides. In preparation for the show, they have dispersed* leaflets, put up posters, and sent out cars and
trucks with loudspeakers to extol the erudite* qualities of their candidate. Soon, the crowd gathers. Loyal party
workers come forward to shake the hand of their mentor. Now, with the facile solutions to complex problems
carefully memorized, the show is ready to begin. One moment facetious,* the next moment profound,* the
candidate works to convince the incredulous* among the voters.

Seeing Is Learning
While we are all cognizant* of the importance of words to create certain impressions, gesture is relegated* to a
much lesser role. Gestures are an important concomitant* to even the most vapid speech, enhancing it and giving
the hearer something to look at while he listens. The value of seeing at the same time as listening was shown when
a class at a university, unwieldy because of its large size, was split up. One group was put into a room in close
proximity to good loudspeakers. Every nuance* of the lecturer's voice could be heard clearly. Because they had no
person on whom to place their attention, they soon took on the appearance of extreme lassitude; most students
became lethargic* and rested their heads on their desks. The separation of visual and aural communication tended
to vitiate the learning process. The listening group received grades lower than those received by those who could
look at as well as hear the instructor.
Once more your keen eye and memory were being tested. Did you recognize lassitude as being from an earlier

The Hammy Old Days
Actors depend upon their ability to gesticulate* almost as much as upon speech to obtain their desired histrionic*
effects. With them, gesture serves much more than merely to augment speech. When their communication is by
gesture alone, it is called pantomime. In the early silent motion picture period, gestures were flamboyant.* To show
that he was distraught* about the danger in which the heroine had been placed, the hero would go through the most
fatuous actions. He would stagger, beat his breast, tear his hair, and contort his face into the most doleful*
appearance. There weren't many simple or restrained gestures in his repertoire. The heroine, to indicate her love,
would fling her arms wide and ardently* jump into her sweetheart's arms. It was only much later that actors
became skilled enough to communicate with the audience through discreet* gestures and almost imperceptible
changes in facial expression that could transmit nuances* of emotion.

Queen of the Supermarket
The American housewife is queen of all she surveys in the supermarket. She decides what items shall be
purchased. Grocery manufacturers are well aware of her power to make one product a success and another a
failure. They spend huge sums developing new products with which to curry her favor. Fearful that a successful
product will soon begin to pall, the manufacturers, without cessation,* come out with "new and improved" versions
to whet* her appetite. Sometimes it is only a box or package that has been changedperhaps a colorful photo of a
succulent meal on a TV dinner box. In the larger supermarkets the housewife is faced with a satiety of
merchandise, particularly in the copiously* stocked laundry detergent section. While there may be almost no
intrinsic difference among the many brands, advertising and packaging serves to importune* her to buy one rather
than another.
Did you spot it? The "new word" you've seen before? It's intrinsic.

It's What's Outside That Counts
Packaging of grocery items is a facet* of advertising that is too little appreciated by consumers. Walking up and
down the aisles of a supermarket, one seldom stops to analyze the individual package in the potpourri of items on
the shelves. The manufacturer had to glean* and test many different designs before he accepted the one you see in
the array* before you. Before he will sanction the use of a particular can, box, or bottle, he must know many
things about its efficacy.* He wants to know if the colors attract: a white box may denote cleanliness, a red one,
strength. There may be a photo or a drawing that will allude to the product's use or special qualities. A lackluster*
package may be fatal.* Next, the size and shape are important elements. The housewife may want a small package
for easy storing, but a larger package may suggest economy. A round bottle may look attractive, but a square one
is easier to stack. These are some of the insidious aspects of packaging, the main purpose of which is to attract
your attention as you peruse* the crowded supermarket shelves.

"Tried and True"
Few question the propriety of the current haste on the part of manufacturers to bring out "new and improved"
products at the prevalent* rate. At one time, in the dim, distant past before the advent of television, it was the
vogue* for products to be advertised on the merits of their "tried and true" qualities. Few advertisers were impious
enough to jettison* any part of a product that had been accepted by the public. Year after year, the local grocery
store owner would proffer the same box of cereal, the same house cleaner. The acceptance was of the time-tested

What's in a Name?
Supermarkets now carry their own products to compete with the national brands. These "house" brands are not in a
felicitous* position because they cannot be advertised widely. Supermarkets overcome this encumbrance* by
making these brands less expensive. Many people believe the shibboleth, "You get what you pay for," and they
purchase items on the premise* that quality varies as the price does. Are the claims made by nationally advertised
brands bogus? How can one bread company substantiate its nutritive superiority over another? As there is no
incontrovertible* evidence, the more expensive bread (or coffee, etc.) must compensate* by increased advertising.
They make inordinate* claims, using those raucous techniques proven so successful in convincing the frugal*

Using the clues listed below, fill in each blank in the following story with one of the new words you learned this
week.
Age Discrimination
One of the most
__________ forms of discrimination is that based upon age. We have become aware through
publicity and education that bias and discrimination based upon race, color, creed, and sex are not to be accepted.
Through laws passed by the Congress of the United States and by individual states, we agree that using these
criteria for hiring, promoting, or firing in the workplace is a
__________ and undemocratic excuse. Many
lawsuits have supported this most basic right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" protected by our
Constitution.
Why is it, then, that so few question the
__________ of preventing those viewed as "too old" from getting
positions, or, if already on the job, promotions? Advanced age also leads to the firing of such employees and their
replacement with younger applicants. Is there something
__________ in youth that suggests that older workers
cannot do the job as well? Until age discrimination goes the way of all of the other forms of prejudice, we may
continue to
__________ the reasoning that "younger is better."

You Can't Help But Watch
The consumer is in a quandary about making a felicitous* selection among the array* of products. The advertisers
must influence the malleable* consumer, and often they do it in the most callous ways. Television offers many
tangible* advantages for reaching the consumer. As a result, the consumer is inundated* by commercials. The
advertiser knows that a television commercial is the most expedient way to reach large numbers of people. The cost
for each commercial film is prodigious,* but because the audience is so large, the cost per viewer is negligible.
Each commercial is prepared in the most meticulous* way in order to catch the attention of even the most blasé
viewer and hold it until the message is through.
The reintroduced "new word" should have stood out immediately. Did it? It's callous, of course.
Sample Sentences

Tricks of the Trade
Some television commercials, trying to break through the ennui built up in the viewer by the plethora* of
competition, employ humor. Others feature a comely girl as a pretext* for getting the viewer to stay tuned in. At
times raucous* music, accompanied by some frenetic activities, is designed to preclude* the viewer's loss of
attention. The advertiser will employ every bit of artifice at the film maker's command to make a trenchant*
commercial. The diversity of appeals made to the viewer is a concomitant* of the many ways people react to
commercials. A great deal of time and money has gone into placing the consumer's psychological make-up under
scrutiny.*

Going to the Source
The wide diversity* of reasons people have for buying one product rather than another are investigated by the
advertising people in order to prepare efficacious* commercials. They do not have the slightest qualm about
questioning the consumer about personal things in her own domicile.* The consumer is requested not to expurgate
her answers. Generally, people are not reticent* and do not begrudge giving the time and effort. The questions
delve rather deeply, and what the artless responses divulge* will help the advertiser decide what to put into his
next commercial. After a large number of interviews, the copious* results make it feasible* to prognosticate* how

Despite the antipathy* toward commercials expressed by the viewers, the remarkable success of television
commercials in selling products makes it manifest that the advertiser has gleaned* what the viewer wants to see
and hear from his research interview. This has helped the advertiser delve deeply into what motivates* people
when they go into the supermarket to purchase products. The advertising agency is never capricious and can
vindicate* spending large sums of money on research. Having uncovered what the public wants, the advertiser
expedites* putting the requisite words, music, and photographs of the product on film. He will thus replenish the

It Takes More than Medicine
If one were to look at the roster of physical handicaps, one would reach the somber* conclusion that the list is a
long one. Included would be stunted development of an arm or leg due to a birth anomaly.* Others would be the
result of a crippling disease that has caused muscles to atrophy. The list would go on with illnesses and injuries that
maim and debilitate.* Modern medicine has done much to ameliorate the physical problems. However, there are an
inordinate* number of problems of the handicapped that have still to be alleviated.* People are not naturally
callous,* but in some perverse* way they have the propensity* to repress* any concern with the physically

Doing the Right Thing
The obstacles that frustrate* the physically handicapped person who is seeking employment may turn him into a

handicapped by proffering* employment that is really beneath them and their abilities. The employer appears to be
acting in a benevolent manner, but this attitude shows no compassion,* for he really expects the person seeking the
job to remain subservient. This iniquity cannot but give the handicapped a feeling that they are being discriminated

himself lucky to find any employment.

The employer, on the other hand, will find it conducive* to good work and will not repent his having tried

Socially, the handicapped person is often treated as a pariah. Most people hold themselves aloof from normal
contact with those who are "different." This social separation propagates* additional feelings of antipathy*. If
"normal" individuals would socialize with the handicapped individual, they would learn in a pragmatic way that
these are people who happen to have a physical handicap; the handicap does not make them any less human. The
iniquity* of assuming that physical superiority equals moral superiority prevents all of us from direct human
relationships. As long as there is a vestige of feeling that handicapped people are inferior, then we are all

Whistle Blowing
There appears to be a question of how much loyalty employees owe to their employerswhether private or
governmental. Many companies go out of their way to encourage employees to make suggestions that will improve
the way they operate. A
__________ employer will not criticize or reprimand an employee who points out
problems having to do with the way other employees are harming the business. In fact, it should be in the bosses'
interest that the person who has become known as a "whistle blower" is encouraged to alert them to a problem.
However, many such whistle blowers face harsh punishment for calling attention to illegal or unethical actions. The
whistle blower soon becomes a
__________ in the workplace. Under the
__________ of some minor error,
or other excuse, the informer might be demoted, transferred, or fired. This
__________ often goes unreported.
As a result, the employees go back to "business as usual" without any change. They become used to whatever they
may see around them and to the belief that they should not make waves. Thus, no attempt to
situation actually takes place.

Good News-and Bad
One of the latent* dangers indigenous* to our constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press has to do with the

libel laws that protect against false charges. If an individual believes his character or livelihood have been damaged
by a defamatory article, he can sue. As the plaintiff he must refute* the story and show how the defendant caused
him harm by printing a canard. The defendant attempts to substantiate* the truth of the article. The printing of
news may besmirch* an individual's character, but there is no way to alleviate* this problem without changes in the
Constitution. This would be tantamount* to destroying the efficacy* of our coveted* right to learn the truth from
the press. We all deprecate a situation in which someone suffers because of exposure in the newspapers. Only

The Island of Wild Dogs
The saga* of the introduction of that diminutive song bird, the canary, into the homes of the world as tame pets is
an interesting one. In the sixteenth century a trading ship going to Italy stopped at an island named "Canis," from
the Latin word for wild dog, which could be found there in profuse numbers, off the coast of Africa. The dulcet
song of the wild birds whetted* the interest of the captain. In impromptu cages hundreds were taken aboard to be
traded. The sailors called these gray-green birds, spotted with yellow, "canaries." As they approached the island of
Elba, near Italy, a malevolent storm put the boat in jeopardy* of sinking. A member of the crew released the birds,
and the intrepid* canaries instinctively flew towards land. The peasants on Elba took the wild canaries in as pets.
Eventually, the birds found their way into homes throughout Europe where they were domesticated and bred for
variety of song and shades of colors. The canaries prevalent* today differ greatly from the ones discovered over
four hundred years ago.

Reprieve for Wolves
One of the most difficult problems to resolve has to do with the conflicting interests of environmentalists and
profit-making businesses. Examples of this dilemma appear frequently. While the dispute about cutting down a
forest to preserve owls has been in the news, there appeared another conflict in the state of Alaska. Hoping to
increase the number of tourists who seek to hunt deer and caribou, the State of Alaska ordered the killing of some
of the
__________ number of wolves who prey on those animals.
This resulted in a
__________ of letters and articles condemning the
__________ that would result from the
anti-wolf policy. So, once again, the environmentalists, who maintain that the natural balance should not be
interfered with, ran up against the Alaskan tourist industry, which wants to attract hunters who will increase the
state's revenue. After much publicity about the wolf hunt and articles that tended to
__________ this policy,
Alaska decided to
__________ the proposed action.

Henry VIII and British History
Students in the United States should consider themselves lucky when it comes to studying the country's history.
The United States has been a nation for approximately 225 years. We would be
__________ if we had to learn
as much history as students in Great Britain, for their history goes back some 1,000 years! In that time England has
had many interesting and unusual rulers. One who has fascinated us is Henry VIII. Ruling some 450 years ago, he
became well known because of his many marriages and his
__________ for doing away with some wives who
displeased him.
In physical appearance he was unattractivehe was large and
__________. When his first wife could not bear him
a son who would be heir to the throne, he divorced her. This caused a break with the Pope who refused to
recognize the divorce. Henry VIII sent an
__________ to the Pope and renounced Catholicism. He then married
Anne Boleyn but decided to
__________ her after quickly tiring of her. His third wife died in childbirth, and he
divorced his fourth. His fifth, Katherine Howard, was also beheaded. Only his sixth wife was able to live on after
Henry's death in 1547. From this brief history of only one English ruler, it is easy to imagine how much an English
history student must learn in order to prepare for an exam. In Henry VIII's case, one would have to get a "head
start."

A Mighty Empire
One of the anomalies* of our approach to history is the propensity* to study the venerable* empires of Europe, but
we do not feel it incumbent* upon us to ascertain anything about the civilizations in our own hemisphere. We
deprecate* the history of this part of the world as though progress lay dormant and that other peoples were
irrelevant* until the settlers of North America arrived at Plymouth Rock. In South America, from 2000 B.C. until
their empire reached its acme* at the beginning of the 16th century, lived the Incas. The site* of the capital city of
the Inca empire, Cusco, lay at a height of 11,000 feet. This civilization is reputed* to have burgeoned until it
covered more than 2,500 miles of the western part of the continent. Its population fluctuated* between 4 and 7
million. This empire had a highly efficacious* political and social system. Its potentate ruled with absolute power.
As the empire conquered new lands, it would disseminate its language, religion, and social customs.

A Battle for Power
The Inca emperor derived his prodigious* power and authority from the gods. The paramount* god was the sun
god. It was from him the ruler passed on his prerogative to rule to his most astute* son. This nepotism had worked
with great efficacy* for centuries. The land holdings were immense;* there were rich farmlands and llamas and
alpacas for wool. Precious metals were plentiful: silver, copper, bronze, and the most sacred of all, gold. This metal
resembled the sun god whom they extolled.* There was no dearth of idols and ornaments hammered from this
gleaming metal. There was always more gold coming from the mines to replenish* the supply. At the acme* of his
power, the Inca ruler died without naming the requisite* successor. In 1493 two sons began an internecine struggle
for control. For the next 40 years the empire sank into the lassitude* caused by civil war.

A Perfidious* Conqueror
The feuding between the rival sons reached its pinnacle* in 1532; at that moment Francisco Pizarro came onto the
scene. A native of Spain, he was sojourning* in Panama when he heard of the riches to be found in that far off
land. Overwhelmed with cupidity,* but still a tyro when it came to wresting* power and wealth from hapless*
people, he joined with an inveterate* adventurer. They gathered a small band of mercenaries.* The first two
attempts failed, and Pizarro returned to Spain to request authority and money in order to conquer the West Coast of
South America. Whether by sophistry or cajolery,* he was given the requisite* aid. With a force of 180 men, the
dregs* of society, he invaded Inca territory. He reached the city where the current ruler, Atahualpa, was holding
court. The Incas welcomed Pizarro who, in a factitious display of friendship, heaped encomiums upon Atahualpa.
Unknown to the Incas, Pizarro had brought guns that were still beyond the technology* of these people. The
obloquy of his next act, ambushing the Incas and taking Atahualpa prisoner, will live in the history books that are
replete* with tales of conquest.

The End of an Empire
The Machiavellian* Pizarro held the captured Atahualpa for ransom. He was adamant* about receiving a room
filled with gold to the height of a man's shoulder. This was taken as a hyperbole at first, but Pizarro knew the
gullible* Incas would be munificent when it came to rescuing their sacred ruler. They did not procrastinate,* and a
frenetic* collection of gold took place. Pizarro, to whom prevarication* was natural in dealing with the Incas, had
no qualms* about executing their ruler as soon as he had the gold. The Inca empire was moribund,* but the
charisma that surrounded Atahualpa was such that, after his death, the Incas fought on tenaciously* in his name for
several years. Eventually, superior weapons quelled* all opposition. A policy of genocide was adopted by the
Spanish conquerors, and almost two million of these proud people died in the carnage* that followed. The saga* of
an ancient civilization thus came to an end.
